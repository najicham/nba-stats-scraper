## PROMPT FOR SESSION 79

Copy/paste this to continue the placeholder line remediation project:

I'm continuing the placeholder line remediation project from Session 78.

**Quick Status**: Phase 1 validation gate is deployed (worker 00044-g7f) but coordinator times out when starting prediction batches, blocking Phase 4a validation.

**Your immediate task**:

1. Read the handoff: `docs/09-handoff/2026-01-17-SESSION-78-PHASE1-DEPLOYMENT-HANDOFF.md`

2. Fix coordinator timeout by bypassing batch historical loading:
   - Edit `predictions/coordinator/coordinator.py` line ~396
   - Set `batch_historical_games = None` (skip batch loading)
   - Copy `shared/` module and redeploy coordinator

3. Test Phase 4a validation - THE CRITICAL TEST:
   ```bash
   # Trigger Jan 9
   curl -X POST https://prediction-coordinator-756957797294.us-west2.run.app/start \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
     -H "X-API-Key: 0B5gc7vv9oNZYjST9lhe4rY2jEG2kYdz" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"game_date": "2026-01-09", "min_minutes": 15, "force": true}'

   # Validate (MUST have 0 placeholders!)
   bq query --nouse_legacy_sql "
   SELECT game_date, system_id, COUNT(*) as count,
          COUNTIF(current_points_line = 20.0) as placeholders
   FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.player_prop_predictions\`
   WHERE game_date = '2026-01-09'
     AND created_at >= TIMESTAMP('2026-01-17 04:30:00')
   GROUP BY game_date, system_id"
   ```

4. If successful (0 placeholders), proceed to:
   - Phase 4b: Regenerate XGBoost V1 (53 dates)
   - Phase 5: Setup monitoring views
   - Final validation

**Project**: `/home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper`
**Progress**: 65% (Phases 1-3 done, 4a blocked by coordinator timeout)
