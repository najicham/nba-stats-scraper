Read this handoff guide:
  docs/09-handoff/SESSION-81-QUICK-START.md

Quick context:
- Session 79: Fixed pipeline crash (Phase 3, 4, 5 Docker builds)
- Session 80: Fixed GCS permissions, verified CatBoost V8 working (16% deployed)
- Today: Verify 100% deployment, fix coordinator, cleanup

First command to run:
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT ROUND(confidence_score*100) as confidence,
       COUNT(*) as predictions
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.player_prop_predictions\`
WHERE system_id = 'catboost_v8' AND game_date = '2026-01-18'
GROUP BY confidence
ORDER BY confidence DESC"

Expected: Variety of confidence levels (79-95%), NO 50% predictions
If SUCCESS: CatBoost V8 fully deployed! 🎉
If FAILURE: Force redeploy prediction-worker (instructions in guide)
