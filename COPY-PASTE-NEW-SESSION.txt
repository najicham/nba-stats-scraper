docs/09-handoff/2026-01-07-MLB-COLLECTION-HANDOFF-FOR-NEW-SESSION.md

QUICK STATUS (as of Jan 7, 2:50 PM PST):
- Re-collection running with pitcher stats fix
- 2025: Started 2:47 PM, ETA ~3:40 PM
- 2024: Auto-starts after 2025, ETA ~4:30 PM
- Analytics + ML ready after ~4:30 PM

IMMEDIATE CHECK:
```bash
# Is collection still running?
ps aux | grep "collect_season" | grep -v grep

# Check progress
tail -10 logs/mlb_2025_recollect.log
tail -10 logs/mlb_2024_recollect.log

# Check BigQuery data
bq query --nouse_legacy_sql 'SELECT season_year, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM mlb_raw.mlb_pitcher_stats WHERE game_date >= "2024-01-01" GROUP BY 1'
```

IF COLLECTION COMPLETE (~9,800+ rows):
```bash
# 1. Run analytics
PYTHONPATH=. python -m data_processors.analytics.mlb.pitcher_game_summary_processor \
  --start-date 2024-03-28 --end-date 2025-09-28

# 2. Train model
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/mlb/train_pitcher_strikeouts.py
```

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- mlb_pitcher_stats: ~9,800+ rows
- pitcher_game_summary: ~9,800+ rows after analytics
- Model MAE: < 1.92 (baseline)

KEY FIX THIS SESSION:
- Collection wasn't storing pitcher stats to BigQuery
- Added load_pitcher_stats() to collect_season.py
- Created mlb_pitcher_stats table
- Updated analytics processor to use new table
