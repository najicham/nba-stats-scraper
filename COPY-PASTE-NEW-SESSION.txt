MLB Pitcher Strikeouts Pipeline - Check Back Session (Jan 7, ~4 PM PST)

Read docs/09-handoff/2026-01-07-MLB-PIPELINE-FIX-AND-COLLECTION.md for full context.

CURRENT STATUS (as of Jan 7, 1:15 PM PST):
- Fixed critical data pipeline gap (pitcher stats weren't being stored)
- Auto-collection running in background (PID in logs/mlb_auto_collection.log)
- Expected completion: ~4:00 PM PST

QUICK STATUS CHECK:
```bash
# 1. Check auto-collection progress
tail -20 logs/mlb_auto_collection.log

# 2. Check if collections running
pgrep -f "collect_season"

# 3. Check pitcher stats in BigQuery
bq query --nouse_legacy_sql 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mlb_raw.mlb_pitcher_stats WHERE game_date >= "2024-01-01"'
```

IF COLLECTIONS COMPLETE (expect ~4,900+ pitcher starts):
```bash
# 1. Run analytics pipeline
PYTHONPATH=. python -m data_processors.analytics.mlb.pitcher_game_summary_processor \
  --start-date 2024-03-28 --end-date 2025-09-28

# 2. Train ML model
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/mlb/train_pitcher_strikeouts.py
```

TARGET: Beat baseline MAE 1.92
