## October 4, 2025 - Path Normalization Fix & Multi-Processor Expansion

**Status:** Production Deployed

### Critical Bug Fix: Path Normalization

**Problem Identified:**
- BigQuery stores paths without `gs://bucket/` prefix: `nba-com/player-list/2025-10-01/file.json`
- GCS Inspector returns full paths: `gs://nba-scraped-data/nba-com/player-list/2025-10-01/file.json`
- Gap detector was querying for full path, finding 0 records, triggering false alerts

**Impact:**
- All gap checks were returning false positives
- File at `gs://nba-scraped-data/nba-com/player-list/2025-10-01/20251001_220717.json` was processed successfully (615 records on 2025-10-03) but detector reported gap

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `_normalize_file_path()` method to `gap_detector.py`
- Strips `gs://bucket-name/` prefix before querying BigQuery
- Applied to both `_check_file_processed()` and `_get_record_count()` methods

**Code Changes:**
```python
def _normalize_file_path(self, file_path: str) -> str:
    """Normalize GCS path to match BigQuery storage format."""
    if file_path.startswith('gs://'):
        path_parts = file_path.replace('gs://', '').split('/', 1)
        if len(path_parts) > 1:
            return path_parts[1]
    return file_path
```

**Validation:**
- Tested on 2025-10-01 data
- Before fix: "found 0 records" (false gap)
- After fix: "found 615 records" (correct)

### Feature: Multi-Processor Support

**Processors Added:**

1. **bdl_player_boxscores** (Critical, Revenue Impact)
   - Pattern: `ball-dont-lie/boxscores/{date}/`
   - Tolerance: 4 hours
   - Expected: 200-1000 records
   - Priority: Critical for prop bet settlement

2. **bdl_active_players** (High, Revenue Impact)
   - Pattern: `ball-dont-lie/active-players/{date}/`
   - Tolerance: 6 hours
   - Expected: 500-600 records
   - Priority: Player validation cross-check

3. **bdl_injuries** (High, Revenue Impact)
   - Pattern: `ball-dont-lie/injuries/{date}/`
   - Tolerance: 8 hours
   - Expected: 10-200 records
   - Priority: Backup injury data source

4. **bdl_standings** (Medium)
   - Pattern: `ball-dont-lie/standings/2024-25/{date}/`
   - Tolerance: 12 hours
   - Expected: 30 records
   - Priority: Team performance context

**Configuration Enhancement:**
- Added `gcs_pattern_type` field to support multiple path patterns
- Implemented pattern types: `simple_date`, `date_nested`, `season_based`
- Added helper functions: `get_processors_by_pattern()`, `print_config_summary()`

**Total Coverage:**
- Before: 1 processor (nbac_player_list)
- After: 5 processors
- Revenue-impacting: 4 processors

### Documentation Created

**New Files:**
1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - System design and component interactions
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Design decision rationale
   - Database schema requirements
   - Performance and cost analysis

2. **ADDING_PROCESSORS.md**
   - Step-by-step guide for adding new processors
   - Pattern-specific guidance
   - Testing checklist
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Full working examples

3. **UPDATES.md** (this file)
   - Change log and version history
   - Bug fix documentation
   - Feature additions

**Updated Files:**
- `README.md` - Added quick links to new documentation
- `utils/gap_detector.py` - Path normalization fix
- `config/processor_config.py` - 4 new processors, pattern flexibility

### Testing Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Processors Tested:** nbac_player_list  
**Result:** Path normalization fix validated

**Before Fix:**
```
INFO - File processing check: gs://nba-scraped-data/nba-com/player-list/2025-10-01/20251001_220717.json found 0 records
ERROR - Processing Gap Detected (FALSE POSITIVE)
```

**After Fix:**
```
INFO - File processing check: nba-com/player-list/2025-10-01/20251001_220717.json found 615 records
INFO - âœ… No processing gaps detected for 2025-10-01
```

### Next Steps

**Immediate:**
- Deploy updated code to Cloud Run
- Test all 5 processors with historical dates
- Verify Slack alerts work correctly

**Short-term:**
- Add remaining simple_date pattern processors (espn_scoreboard, etc.)
- Enable Cloud Scheduler for NBA season start
- Monitor for false positives with new processors

**Future Enhancement:**
- Enhanced GCS inspector for nested path patterns
- Enable `nbac_injury_report` (date_nested pattern)
- Enable `odds_api_props_history` (date_nested pattern)

## August 31, 2025 - Initial Phase 1 Deployment

**Status:** Deployed to Production

### Initial Implementation

**Scope:**
- Single processor monitoring: `nbac_player_list`
- Manual execution only (no Cloud Scheduler)
- Slack notifications working
- Email notifications disabled (missing fuzzywuzzy dependency)

**Architecture:**
- Standalone Cloud Run job (not integrated into processor workflow)
- Direct import of notification_system to avoid dependency bloat
- Configurable tolerance windows per processor
- Foundation for Phase 2 automated retry

**Coverage:**
- GCS Bucket: `nba-scraped-data`
- Pattern: `nba-com/player-list/{date}/`
- BigQuery Table: `nba_raw.nbac_player_list_current`
- Tolerance: 6 hours

**Deployment Details:**
- Region: us-west2
- Service Account: `nba-processors@nba-props-platform.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Memory: 2Gi
- Timeout: 30 minutes
- Max Retries: 2

### Design Decisions

**Why Standalone Job?**
- Monitoring should be independent of systems it monitors
- Easier to debug without affecting data pipeline
- Can check multiple days/processors in single run
- Different schedule than data processing

**Why Manual Execution?**
- Phase 1 proof of concept
- Validate detection logic before automation
- NBA off-season (no urgent need for hourly checks)

**Why Single Processor?**
- Test case with simple characteristics
- MERGE_UPDATE strategy straightforward
- High visibility for validation
- Foundation for expanding to other processors

### Known Limitations

**Email Alerts:**
- Disabled due to missing fuzzywuzzy dependency in shared/requirements.txt
- Slack alerts working correctly
- Low priority - Slack sufficient for Phase 1

**Single Processor:**
- Only nbac_player_list monitored
- Manual expansion needed for other processors
- Planned for Phase 2

**No Automatic Retry:**
- Logs retry information only
- Manual intervention required
- Phase 2 feature

## Planned Future Updates

### Phase 2: Auto-Retry & Multi-Processor (Q4 2025)

**Goals:**
- Automatic retry via pub/sub for detected gaps
- Expand to 10-15 high-priority processors
- Configurable retry policies
- Track retry attempts in BigQuery

**Processors to Add:**
- `nbac_schedule` - NBA.com schedule
- `odds_api_props` - Odds API props (critical)
- `nbac_gamebook` - NBA.com gamebooks
- `espn_scoreboard` - ESPN game results
- `bigdataball_pbp` - Enhanced play-by-play

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Monitoring (Q1 2026)

**Goals:**
- Scraper success/failure monitoring
- Performance tracking (processing time, error rates)
- Data quality validation (schema, nulls, ranges)
- Real-time alerting via Cloud Functions
- Dashboard for system health

**Implementation:**
- Cloud Function triggered on GCS file creation
- Track scraper runs in monitoring table
- SLA tracking and reporting
- Predictive alerting based on historical patterns
