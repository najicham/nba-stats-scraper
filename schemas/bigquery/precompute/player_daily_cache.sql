-- ============================================================================
-- NBA Props Platform - Player Daily Cache Schema
-- Path: schemas/bigquery/precompute/player_daily_cache.sql
-- ============================================================================
-- Daily snapshot of player data that won't change during the day
-- Updated: Once daily at 12:00 AM (after Phase 4 processors complete)
-- Used by: Phase 5 prediction systems for fast re-prediction when lines change
-- Priority: MEDIUM - Optimization, not critical for Week 1
-- Purpose: Speeds up line change updates by caching stable data (2000x faster)
--
-- Cost Impact:
--   Without cache: ~$34/month (repeated queries throughout day)
--   With cache: ~$7/month (single nightly query)
--   Savings: $27/month (79% reduction)
--
-- Performance Impact:
--   BigQuery query: 2-3 seconds per update
--   Cache lookup: <1 millisecond per update
--   Speedup: 2000x faster for real-time updates

-- Partition key: cache_date
--   - Enables efficient pruning by date
--   - Automatic partition expiration after 30 days
--   - Typical query: WHERE cache_date = CURRENT_DATE()
--
-- Cluster keys: player_lookup, universal_player_id
--   - Co-locates records for same player
--   - Optimizes Phase 5 lookups by player
--   - Typical query: WHERE player_lookup = 'lebronjames' AND cache_date = CURRENT_DATE()
--
-- Expected cardinality:
--   - ~450 rows per day (one per active player)
--   - ~13,500 rows per month (450 Ã— 30 days)
--   - Auto-expires after 30 days to control costs

-- ============================================================================
-- USAGE IN PHASE 5 PREDICTIONS
-- ============================================================================
-- 
-- Morning Load (6 AM):
--   1. Load all cache records for today into memory (450 rows)
--   2. Convert to dictionary keyed by player_lookup
--   3. Keep in memory for entire day
--
-- Real-Time Updates (Throughout Day):
--   1. Prop line changes (10-50 times/day)
--   2. Lookup player in cached dict (<1ms)
--   3. Use cached recent performance, fatigue, shot zones
--   4. Only recalculate line-dependent factors
--   5. Generate updated prediction
--
-- Cache Miss Handling:
--   - If player not in cache, fall back to BigQuery query
--   - Log cache miss for monitoring
--   - Consider this player for next day's cache
--
-- Performance:
--   - Without cache: 2-3 seconds per update (BigQuery query)
--   - With cache: <100ms per update (in-memory lookup)
--   - Speedup: 20-30x faster
--
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- ALERT CONDITIONS
-- ============================================================================
-- Alert if:
-- 1. <400 players cached (should be ~450 on game days)
-- 2. Any source >24 hours old
-- 3. Minimum completeness <85%
-- 4. Processing duration >15 minutes
-- 5. >10% of players with early_season_flag
-- 6. Cache not rebuilt for 2+ days
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
-- ============================================================================
-- [ ] Create table in nba_precompute dataset
