-- PLAYER REGISTRY INTEGRATION:
-- =============================================================================
-- The processor uses RegistryReader (lenient consumer pattern) to resolve players:
-- 
-- 1. For each player, attempts to resolve universal_player_id from registry
-- 2. If found: universal_player_id is populated
-- 3. If NOT found: universal_player_id is NULL, player added to unresolved queue
-- 4. Unresolved players logged to: nba_reference.unresolved_player_names
-- 5. Manual review creates aliases or new registry entries to resolve
-- 6. Re-running processor backfills universal_player_id after aliases created
--
-- Resolution Rate Target: >95% (typical: 85-90% first run, 95%+ after aliases)
-- =============================================================================

-- DATA QUALITY NOTES:
-- 1. source_file_date is CRITICAL for processing gap detection monitoring
-- 2. HTML scraper populates: name, number, position, height, weight, playerId
-- 3. API scraper populates: all fields including age, college, birth info, injuries
-- 4. Processor must handle both data structures (see processor documentation)
-- 5. MERGE strategy deletes + inserts on (roster_date, scrape_hour, team_abbr)
-- 6. Registry processor validates against NBA.com canonical player set
-- 7. Most unresolved players are suffix variations (Jr., Sr., II, III)

-- USAGE EXAMPLES:
-- =============================================================================
-- Check resolution rate:
SELECT 
  roster_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_players,
  COUNT(universal_player_id) as resolved,
  ROUND(COUNT(universal_player_id) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as resolution_pct
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.espn_team_rosters`
WHERE roster_date >= CURRENT_DATE() - 7
GROUP BY roster_date
ORDER BY roster_date DESC;

-- Find unresolved players:
SELECT 
  roster_date,
  team_abbr,
  player_full_name,
  player_lookup,
  jersey_number,
  position
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.espn_team_rosters`
WHERE universal_player_id IS NULL
  AND roster_date = CURRENT_DATE()
ORDER BY team_abbr, player_full_name;

-- Join with registry for enriched data:
SELECT 
  r.roster_date,
  r.team_abbr,
  r.player_full_name,
  r.espn_player_id,
  reg.universal_player_id,
  reg.nba_player_id,
  reg.nba_canonical_name,
  reg.jersey_number as registry_jersey
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.espn_team_rosters` r
LEFT JOIN `nba-props-platform.nba_reference.nba_players_registry` reg
  ON r.universal_player_id = reg.universal_player_id
WHERE r.roster_date = CURRENT_DATE()
  AND r.team_abbr = 'LAL'
ORDER BY r.jersey_number;
