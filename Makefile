# === CLOUD DEPLOYMENT (Primary workflow) ===
deploy: ## Deploy scrapers to Cloud Run
	@./bin/deploy_scrapers.sh

test: ## Test Cloud Run deployment
	@./bin/test_scrapers.sh

logs: ## View Cloud Run logs
	@gcloud run services logs tail nba-scrapers --region us-west2

deploy-test: deploy test ## Deploy and test in one command

# === LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ===
dev-up: ## Start local development environment
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

dev-down: ## Stop local development environment
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

dev-logs: ## View local development logs
