# NBA Data Pipeline - Comprehensive Implementation Reference

## Executive Summary

This document captures the complete analysis of the NBA prop betting data pipeline, documenting **23+ scrapers** across **4 data sources** and providing the architectural foundation for a comprehensive betting analytics system.

### **Core Business Objective**
Build a website with NBA player prop betting data, historical performance analysis, and predictive forecasting for **player points prop bets** (initially), with plans to expand to other prop types.

### **Key Achievement**
Successfully documented and designed schemas for a complete data pipeline that:
- **Collects prop betting lines** from multiple sportsbooks
- **Cross-references players** across 4+ different ID systems  
- **Links betting events** to actual NBA games and player statistics
- **Tracks historical performance** for predictive modeling
- **Supports real-time updates** throughout the season
- **Validates player team assignments** through multi-source intelligence including paginated BDL Active Players data

## **Player Team Lookup Implementation**

### **Core Business Problem**
Odds API provides player names without team context: `"Jaylen Wells"` has props but no team indicated. Need to determine if he plays for LAL or MEM when they play each other.

### **Cloud Architecture Implementation**

#### **Data Collection Pipeline (Cloud Run + Pub/Sub)**
```yaml
# Google Cloud Workflow orchestrates scraper execution
daily_player_intelligence_workflow:
  steps:
    - trigger_scrapers:
        parallel:
          - nba_player_list: "Deploy to Cloud Run"
          - bdl_active_players: "Deploy to Cloud Run (5-6 API requests, aggregated)" 
          - player_movement: "Deploy to Cloud Run"
    
    - scrapers_publish_completion:
        action: "Each scraper publishes to Pub/Sub when complete"
        message_format: 
          file_path: "/raw-data/ball-dont-lie/active-players/2025-07-18/20250718_143000.json"
          data_source: "ball-dont-lie"
          data_type: "active-players"
          status: "success"
          pagination_complete: true

    - processors_subscribe:
        action: "Raw data processors triggered by Pub/Sub messages"
        processors: ["raw-nba-processor", "raw-bdl-processor"]
        output: "Raw database tables with source lineage"

    - unified_lookup_processor:
        trigger: "After all raw processors complete"
        action: "Build unified player_team_lookup table"
        logic: "Cross-validate sources, resolve conflicts, optimize for prop lookups"
```

#### **Processing Flow**
1. **Cloud Workflow** schedules and orchestrates scraper execution
2. **Cloud Run scrapers** collect data and store in GCS (including multi-request pagination)
3. **Pub/Sub notifications** trigger when scrape files are ready
4. **Raw data processors** move GCS files → raw database tables
5. **Unified lookup processor** builds business table from raw sources
6. **Prop betting system** queries unified table for fast lookups

### **Multi-Source Intelligence Strategy**

*Note: Code examples below illustrate processing logic. Actual implementation uses Cloud Run processors triggered by Pub/Sub.*

#### **Raw Data Processing (Individual Processors)**
*Each scraper triggers its own processor via Pub/Sub:*
- **raw-nba-processor**: NBA.com Player List → `raw_nba_com_player_list` table
- **raw-bdl-processor**: BDL Active Players → `raw_bdl_active_players` table  
- **raw-espn-processor**: ESPN Rosters → `raw_espn_team_rosters` table

#### **Unified Lookup Generation (Dedicated Processor)**
*Separate processor builds business table after raw data is available:*
```python
# Illustrative logic for unified lookup processor
def build_unified_player_lookup():
    # Get latest data from all raw sources
    nba_players = query_latest_nba_players()
    bdl_players = query_latest_bdl_players()
    
    # Cross-validate and build consensus
    unified_lookup = {}
    for nba_player in nba_players:
        player_name = f"{nba_player['first_name']} {nba_player['last_name']}"
        
        # Find matching BDL player
        bdl_match = find_bdl_player_by_name(player_name, bdl_players)
        
        # Determine consensus team and confidence
        consensus_team, confidence = resolve_team_assignment(
            nba_player['team'], bdl_match['team'] if bdl_match else None
        )
        
        unified_lookup[player_name] = {
            'team_abbr': consensus_team,
            'confidence_score': confidence,
            'nba_com_player_id': nba_player['id'],
            'bdl_player_id': bdl_match['id'] if bdl_match else None
        }
    
    # Update unified table
    update_player_team_lookup_table(unified_lookup)
```

#### **Prop Betting Integration (Business Logic)**
*Fast lookups from unified table for prop processing:*
```python
# Illustrative logic for prop processing
def process_player_props(props_data):
    enriched_props = []
    
    for prop in props_data['outcomes']:
        player_name = prop['description']  # "Jaylen Wells"
        
        # Fast lookup from unified table
        player_info = lookup_player_team(player_name)
        
        if player_info and player_info['confidence_score'] > 0.8:
            enriched_props.append({
                'player_name': player_name,
                'team_abbr': player_info['team_abbr'],  # "MEM"
                'line_value': prop['point'],
                'odds': prop['price']
            })
    
    return enriched_props
```

## **Multi-Request Scraper Patterns**

### **Aggregated Single-File Pattern (Recommended)**
For scrapers requiring multiple API calls (like BdlActivePlayersScraper):

#### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Atomic operations**: All data or none (data consistency)
- ✅ **Simplified processor logic**: One file to process
- ✅ **Easy monitoring**: Single success/failure per scraper run
- ✅ **Consistent pattern**: Matches single-request scrapers
- ✅ **Rate limit friendly**: Controlled request timing

#### **Implementation Pattern:**
```python
# Example: BdlActivePlayersScraper implementation
class BdlActivePlayersScraper(ScraperBase):
    def scrape(self):
        all_players = []
        cursor = None
        request_count = 0
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Collect all pages with rate limiting
        while True:
            if request_count > 0:
                time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms delay (well under 600/min limit)
            
            response = self.get_players_page(cursor)
            all_players.extend(response['data'])
            request_count += 1
            
            cursor = response['meta'].get('next_cursor')
            if not cursor:
                break
        
        # Save aggregated result
        return self.save_aggregated_data({
            'timestamp': start_time,
            'scraper': 'bdl_active_players',
            'meta': {
                'request_count': request_count,
                'total_players': len(all_players),
                'pagination_complete': True,
                'execution_time_seconds': time.time() - start_time
            },
            'data': all_players
        })
```

#### **File Structure:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-20T08:00:00Z",
  "scraper": "bdl_active_players",
  "meta": {
    "request_count": 5,
    "total_players": 487,
    "pagination_complete": true,
    "execution_time_seconds": 2.3,
    "source": "ball-dont-lie",
    "endpoint": "players"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 38017703,
      "first_name": "Jaylen",
      "last_name": "Wells",
      "team": {"abbreviation": "MEM"}
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Google Cloud Billing & Cost Management**

### **Recommended Billing Protection**

#### **BigQuery Spending Limits**
```yaml
# Set up BigQuery project-level quotas
bigquery_daily_limits:
  query_bytes_processed: 100 GB/day    # Prevent runaway queries
  storage_limit: 500 GB                # Control storage growth
  estimated_monthly_cost: $50          # Reasonable for this pipeline

bigquery_alerts:
  - threshold: 80% of daily limit
  - threshold: $30 monthly spend
  - threshold: 10 failed queries/hour
```

#### **Cloud Run Spending Limits** 
```yaml
# Prevent runaway scraper costs
cloud_run_limits:
  max_instances_per_service: 5         # Limit concurrent scrapers
  request_timeout: 900 seconds         # Allow time for multi-request scrapers
  memory_limit: 2 GB                   # Control memory usage
  estimated_monthly_cost: $25          # Updated for additional BDL requests
```

#### **Overall Project Billing Alerts**
```yaml
# Project-wide cost controls
project_billing_alerts:
  - $25: "Low alert - normal monthly spend"
  - $75: "Medium alert - investigate unusual activity" 
  - $150: "High alert - potential runaway costs"
  - $200: "Critical alert - consider billing account protection"

# Automatic spending limits (optional but recommended)
billing_account_budget:
  monthly_limit: $100
  automatic_stop: true                 # Stop all services if exceeded
  grace_period: 24 hours              # Time to investigate before shutdown
```

### **Expected Monthly Costs**

| **Service** | **Usage** | **Estimated Cost** |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **BigQuery Storage** | 500MB player data, 90-day retention | $5 |
| **BigQuery Queries** | Daily processing + prop analysis | $10 |
| **Cloud Run** | 80-85 scraper requests/day (includes BDL pagination) | $18 |
| **Cloud Storage** | Raw file storage, 30-day retention | $2 |
| **Pub/Sub** | Message processing | $1 |
| **Cloud Workflows** | Daily orchestration | $1 |
| **Total Estimated** | | **$37/month** |

**Recommended Budget**: $75/month (provides 100% buffer for unexpected usage)

### **Cost Optimization Strategies**
- **BigQuery**: Partition tables by date, expire old data automatically
- **Cloud Run**: Use minimum instances, set appropriate timeouts for multi-request scrapers
- **Cloud Storage**: Use lifecycle policies to delete old raw files
- **Monitoring**: Set up detailed cost breakdown by service for optimization

## **Database Storage Strategy**

### **Hybrid Raw + Processed Approach**

**Strategy**: Store raw scraped data separately by source, then build unified business tables for fast lookups.

#### **Raw Data Tables (Preserve Source Lineage)**
```sql
-- Store every scrape for trade detection and debugging
CREATE TABLE raw_nba_com_player_list (
    scrape_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    person_id INT64 NOT NULL,
    player_first_name STRING,
    player_last_name STRING,
    team_abbreviation STRING,
    raw_data JSON,  -- Complete original API response
    PRIMARY KEY (person_id, scrape_timestamp)
)
PARTITION BY DATE(scrape_timestamp)
OPTIONS (partition_expiration_days = 90);  -- Automatic cleanup

-- Enhanced for paginated scrapers like BDL Active Players
CREATE TABLE raw_bdl_active_players (
    scrape_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    request_count INT64,                    -- Track pagination requests (5-6)
    total_players INT64,                    -- Aggregated player count
    pagination_complete BOOLEAN,            -- Verify full data collection
    execution_time_seconds FLOAT64,         -- Monitor performance
    raw_data JSON,                         -- Complete aggregated response
    PRIMARY KEY (scrape_timestamp)
)
PARTITION BY DATE(scrape_timestamp)
OPTIONS (partition_expiration_days = 90);
```

#### **Unified Business Table (Optimized for Prop Betting)**
```sql
-- Single source of truth for player → team lookup
CREATE TABLE player_team_lookup (
    player_name STRING NOT NULL,           -- "Jaylen Wells" 
    team_abbr STRING NOT NULL,             -- "MEM"
    nba_com_player_id INT64,               -- Cross-reference
    bdl_player_id INT64,                   -- Cross-reference
    confidence_score FLOAT64,              -- Source agreement (0.0-1.0)
    last_updated TIMESTAMP,
    data_sources ARRAY<STRING>,            -- Track which sources contributed
    PRIMARY KEY (player_name)
);
```

### **Raw Data Field Strategy**
**Complete JSON Storage**: Store entire original API response in `raw_data` field for future-proofing and debugging.

**Benefits**:
- **Trade detection**: Compare current vs previous scrapes
- **Source analysis**: Track which source detects trades fastest
- **Debugging**: "What data was available when prop lookup failed?"
- **Future analytics**: Extract new fields without re-scraping
- **Pagination verification**: Confirm complete data collection for multi-request scrapers

### **Data Retention & Archival**
**Automatic Cleanup**: BigQuery partition expiration handles deletion automatically
- **Player data**: 90-day retention (~$5/month storage cost)
- **Supporting data**: 30-day retention for less critical sources
- **No manual scripts**: Built-in partition expiration manages lifecycle

**Historical Preservation**: Archive significant periods (trade deadlines) to Cloud Storage before automatic deletion.

### **2. NBA.com (9 Scrapers) - OFFICIAL DATA**
**Purpose**: Official NBA data with maximum detail and authority
**Strengths**: Official status, comprehensive coverage, authoritative source
**Coverage**: Player list, schedule, boxscores, injuries, play-by-play, transactions
**Strategy**: Primary source for official data with ESPN validation

### **3. Ball Don't Lie API (5 Scrapers) - CORE STATISTICS**
**Purpose**: Reliable NBA game and player statistics with critical player validation
**Strengths**: Comprehensive historical data, reliable game/player IDs, active player validation
**Coverage**: Games (primary), player boxscores (primary), team boxscores, injuries, **active players (paginated)**
**Strategy**: Primary for game data, **critical for player validation** through BdlActivePlayersScraper
**Special Note**: BdlActivePlayersScraper requires 5-6 API requests per run, aggregated into single output file

### **4. ESPN (3 Scrapers) - VALIDATION & BACKUP**
**Purpose**: Rich player data and trade validation
**Strengths**: Fast updates, detailed rosters, comprehensive coverage
**Coverage**: Team rosters (validation), scoreboard (backup), game boxscores (backup)

**Strengths**: Enhanced play-by-play with lineup tracking and coordinates
**Coverage**: Enhanced play-by-play (2-hour delay post-game)
**Strategy**: GCS-only storage, manual promotion for specific analysis

---

## Critical Data Relationships

### **Player Cross-Reference & Team Lookup System**
**Business Challenge**: Odds API provides only player names (no team context) for prop betting
**Critical Use Case**: Convert "Jaylen Wells" → "MEM" for prop analysis, especially during trades

#### **Player Team Lookup Strategy**
**Primary Sources (Multi-Source Intelligence)**:
- **NBA.com Player List**: Official source, 4-6 times/day (1 request each)
- **Ball Don't Lie Active Players**: **Critical validation**, daily (**5-6 paginated requests, aggregated into single file**)
- **ESPN Team Rosters**: Trade validation, 1-2 times/day (30 requests each)  
- **NBA.com Player Movement**: Transaction detection, daily (1 request)

**Total Daily API Usage**: 45-80 requests (trade season intensive, regular season routine, includes BDL pagination)

#### **Player Identification Across Sources**
| **Source** | **ID Format** | **Example** | **Name Format** | **Usage** | **API Pattern** |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Ball Don't Lie** | Integer | `38017703` | `first_name` + `last_name` | Stats & **Validation** | **5-6 requests (paginated)** |
| **ESPN** | String | `"3917376"` | `name` (full name) | Trade Detection | 1 request per team |
| **NBA.com** | Integer | `1630173` | `PLAYER_FIRST_NAME` + `PLAYER_LAST_NAME` | Primary Official | 1 request |
| **Odds API** | Name String | `"Jaylen Wells"` | `description` field | **LOOKUP TARGET** | 1-4 requests |

#### **Player Team Lookup Table (Downstream Processing)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_team_lookup (
    player_name STRING NOT NULL,           -- Optimized for Odds API matching
    team_abbr STRING NOT NULL,             -- Current team (LAL, MEM, etc.)
    player_id STRING NOT NULL,             -- Cross-reference ID
    name_variations ARRAY<STRING>,         -- Nickname variations for matching
    last_updated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,       -- Data freshness tracking
    confidence_score FLOAT64,              -- Multi-source agreement level
    bdl_validation_status BOOLEAN,         -- BDL Active Players confirmation
    PRIMARY KEY (player_name)
);
```

**Lookup Flow**: `"Jaylen Wells"` (Odds API) → `"MEM"` (team_abbr) → Enable prop analysis

#### **Trade Detection & Edge Cases**
- **Same-day trades**: Multi-source validation catches rapid changes
- **G-League assignments**: Player Movement API explains disappeared players  
- **Recent waivers**: Transaction data prevents props on released players
- **Historical analysis**: Use game boxscores when current lookup not needed
- **Pagination failures**: BDL Active Players incomplete data detection

### **Game Linking System**
**Challenge**: Different game ID formats across sources
**Solution**: Master games table linking all sources

| **Source** | **ID Format** | **Example** | **Usage** |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Ball Don't Lie** | Integer | `15908525` | Stats & Results |
| **ESPN** | String | `"401585183"` | Scores & Schedules |
| **NBA.com** | String | `"0022400500"` | Official Data |
| **Odds API** | Hash String | `"242c77a8d5890e18..."` | Betting Events |

**Linking Strategy**:
- Match by: `game_date + team_abbreviations + start_time`
- Handle time zone differences
- Account for postponements and rescheduling

### **Team Standardization**
**Solution**: Standardized team abbreviations as primary keys
**Mapping Examples**:
- Ball Don't Lie: `"LAL"` → NBA.com: `"LAL"` → Odds API: `"Los Angeles Lakers"`
- Consistent `team_abbr` used throughout entire system

- **Output**: player_injuries + game_injury_reports tables
- **Logic**: Distinguish general vs game-specific injury data

---

## Enhanced Error Handling & Monitoring

### **Multi-Request Scraper Error Handling**

#### **BDL Active Players Specific Issues**
- **Partial Pagination**: Check `pagination_complete` flag in output files
- **Rate Limiting**: Monitor BDL 600/minute limit with 5-6 rapid requests
- **Timeout Failures**: Increase Cloud Run timeout for paginated scrapers (15 minutes recommended)
- **Memory Issues**: Monitor aggregation of large datasets in memory
- **Network Interruption**: Implement retry logic for individual failed pages

#### **Enhanced Error Recovery**
```python
def handle_pagination_failure(scraper_name, page_number, error, retry_count=0):
    """Handle pagination failures with intelligent retry"""
    max_retries = 3
    
    if retry_count < max_retries:
        # Exponential backoff for pagination
        sleep_time = (2 ** retry_count) * 0.5  # 0.5, 1, 2 seconds
        time.sleep(sleep_time)
        
        logger.info(
            "retrying_pagination",
            scraper=scraper_name,
            page=page_number,
            retry_count=retry_count
        )
        
        return retry_page(page_number, retry_count + 1)
    else:
        # Mark pagination as incomplete
        logger.error(
            "pagination_failed",
            scraper=scraper_name,
            page=page_number,
            total_retries=max_retries
        )
        return {"pagination_complete": False, "failed_page": page_number}
```

## Key Data Insights & Business Logic

### **Prop Betting Critical Data Flow**
1. **Events API** provides game event IDs
2. **Player Props API** uses event IDs to get betting lines
3. **BDL Active Players** provides critical player validation (5-6 requests, aggregated)
4. **Game Injury Reports** show player availability 
5. **Historical Boxscores** provide performance context
6. **Cross-referenced Player Data** enables accurate matching

### **Player Matching Strategy**
- **Primary**: `player_name + team_abbr + jersey_number`
- **Secondary**: Name variations (nicknames, abbreviations)
- **Validation**: Cross-reference with BDL Active Players aggregated data
- **Confidence scoring**: Track match quality for data validation, include BDL validation status
- **Manual review**: Flag low-confidence matches for verification

### **Data Quality Considerations**

#### **Odds API Challenges**
- **Player names only** (no IDs) → Requires name matching with BDL validation
- **Team full names** → Must map to abbreviations
- **Real-time updates** → Handle rapid odds changes

#### **Cross-Source Timing Issues**
- **Data freshness** varies by source
- **Injury updates** may lag between sources
- **Game postponements** affect all downstream data
- **Pagination timing**: BDL Active Players takes 2-10 seconds for full collection

#### **Missing Data Handling**
- **Graceful degradation**: Process available data
- **Backfill strategies**: Fill gaps when dependencies arrive
- **Data completeness tracking**: Monitor missing relationships
- **Pagination verification**: Ensure complete BDL Active Players data collection

### **Business Intelligence Opportunities**

#### **Prop Betting Analysis**
- **Line movement patterns**: Track how odds change before games
- **Player availability impact**: Quantify how injuries affect lines
- **Historical performance correlation**: Player stats vs prop lines
- **Sportsbook comparison**: FanDuel vs DraftKings line differences
- **Player validation accuracy**: BDL vs NBA.com team assignment agreement

#### **Predictive Modeling Foundation**
- **Player performance trends**: Recent game statistical patterns
- **Matchup analysis**: Historical performance vs specific opponents  
- **Injury impact**: How different injury types affect player performance
- **Rest vs play**: Load management impact on prop values
- **Multi-source confidence**: Use agreement across sources for model weighting
