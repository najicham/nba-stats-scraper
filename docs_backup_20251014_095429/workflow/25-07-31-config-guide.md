- **ESPN Scoreboard ‚Üí ESPN Boxscore**: Must get Game IDs before detailed analysis (Post-Game, Final Check)
- **Player Lists ‚Üí All**: Foundation data for player identification
- **Injury Reports ‚Üí All**: Health status affects all analysis
- **Rosters ‚Üí Stats**: Team composition affects statistical analysis

### **Timing Dependencies**
- **Morning Operations**: Runs before business hours (8 AM) + yesterday's cleanup
- **Real-Time Business**: Runs during active trading (8 AM - 8 PM)
- **Post-Game Collection**: Captures games as they complete (8 PM + 11 PM)
- **Late Night Recovery**: Enhanced PBP available (2 AM - 5+ hours after games)
- **Early Morning Final Check**: Last chance before business day (6 AM)

## üìä Status Tracking & Recovery Strategy

### **Status File Structure**
Each workflow writes execution results to GCS:
```
Path: /workflow-status/YYYY-MM-DD/workflow-name-HHhMMm.json
Example: /workflow-status/2025-08-01/post-game-collection-20h15m.json
```

#### **Status File Format:**
```json
{
  "workflow": "post-game-collection",
  "execution_time": "2025-08-01T20:15:00Z",
  "execution_id": "c434267b-09a0-4c7d-b34f-db68dc767651",
  "total_duration": 342.5,
  "scrapers": {
    "espn_scoreboard_api": {
      "status": "success", 
      "duration": 12.3,
      "http_code": 200
    },
    "espn_game_boxscore": {
      "status": "failed", 
      "error": "timeout",
      "duration": 300.0,
      "dependency_met": true
    },
    "bdl_box_scores": {
      "status": "success",
      "duration": 45.1,
      "http_code": 200
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "espn_scoreboard_api ‚Üí espn_game_boxscore": "blocked_by_failure"
  }
}
```

### **Current Recovery Approach (Option 1)**
**Simple & Reliable Strategy:**
- **Recovery workflows run ALL relevant scrapers**
- **No complex retry logic** - just comprehensive re-execution
- **Processor deduplication** - Data layer handles duplicates
- **Multiple recovery windows** - 2AM, 6AM, next-day 8AM

#### **Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Guaranteed coverage** - Nothing gets missed
- ‚úÖ **Simple to maintain** - No complex failure tracking logic
- ‚úÖ **Reliable operation** - Fewer edge cases and bugs
- ‚úÖ **API headroom** - Current usage well within rate limits

### **Future Smart Recovery (Option 2)**
**Foundation already built** with status tracking:
- **Rich failure data** available in GCS status files
- **Dependency tracking** - Knows which scrapers depend on others
- **Performance metrics** - Duration and error patterns
- **Upgrade path** - Can implement selective retry when needed

#### **Example Smart Recovery Logic:**
```yaml
# Future enhancement possibility
recovery_logic:
  read_status_files: "Yesterday's execution results"
  determine_failures: "Which scrapers actually failed"
  handle_dependencies: "If ESPN Scoreboard failed, retry both ESPN scrapers"
  selective_execution: "Only run failed scrapers + their dependencies"
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Retry Logic

### **Workflow-Level Error Handling**

#### **Real-Time Business (Revenue Critical)**
```yaml
error_handling:
  events_api_failure: 
    action: "Return CRITICAL_FAILURE"
    impact: "Revenue generation blocked"
    business_logic: "Skip Props API (cannot bet without events)"
    recovery: "Next 2-hour execution attempts retry"
  
  props_api_failure:
    action: "Return CRITICAL_FAILURE" 
    impact: "Revenue generation blocked"
    prerequisite: "Events API must succeed first"
    recovery: "Next 2-hour execution attempts retry"
  
  foundation_scraper_failure:
    action: "Continue execution + log warning"
    impact: "Reduced data quality (non-blocking)"
    recovery: "Multiple daily recovery opportunities"
```

#### **All Other Workflows (Non-Revenue)**
```yaml
error_handling:
  individual_scraper_failure:
    action: "Continue execution (exception_policy: continueAll)"
    impact: "Partial data collection"
    business_logic: "Collect what's available"
    recovery: "Multiple recovery workflows attempt retry"
  
  dependency_chain_failure:
    action: "Skip dependent scrapers"
    example: "ESPN Scoreboard fails ‚Üí Skip ESPN Boxscore"
    recovery: "Retry entire chain in recovery workflows"
  
  total_workflow_failure:
    action: "Return failure status + write to GCS"
    impact: "Missing scheduled data collection"
    recovery: "Recovery workflows + next scheduled execution"
```

### **Scraper-Level Error Handling**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Scraper Call] --> B{HTTP Response}
    B -->|200-299| C[Success - Write Status]
    B -->|400-499| D[Client Error - Log & Continue]
    B -->|500-599| E[Server Error - Log & Continue]
    B -->|Timeout| F[Timeout Error - Log & Continue]
    
    C --> G[Continue Workflow]
    D --> H[Mark Failed in Status]
    E --> H
    F --> H
    H --> I{Critical Scraper?}
    I -->|Yes - Real-Time Business| J[Workflow Failure]
    I -->|No - All Others| K[Continue + Recovery Later]
    
    style C fill:#96ceb4
    style J fill:#ff6b6b
    style K fill:#ffd93d
```

### **Recovery Time Windows**
- **Immediate**: Next scheduled execution of same workflow
- **Same Day**: 2AM Late Night Recovery + 6AM Final Check
- **Next Day**: 8AM Morning Operations (final cleanup)
- **Manual**: Workflows can be manually triggered if needed

---

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

## üéØ Performance Optimization

### **Execution Time Targets**
- **Early Morning Final Check**: < 10 minutes (final comprehensive sweep)
- **Morning Operations**: < 10 minutes (comprehensive setup + Enhanced PBP recovery)
- **Real-Time Business**: < 5 minutes (revenue critical, frequent execution)
- **Post-Game Collection**: < 8 minutes (core game data collection)
- **Late Night Recovery**: < 12 minutes (Enhanced PBP + comprehensive retry)

### **Daily Execution Pattern**
**Total Daily Executions:** 12 workflow runs
- **6:00 AM**: Final Check (1)
- **8:00 AM**: Morning Operations (1) + Real-Time Business #1 (1)  
- **10:00 AM - 8:00 PM**: Real-Time Business #2-7 (6)
- **8:00 PM**: Post-Game Collection #1 (1)
- **11:00 PM**: Post-Game Collection #2 (1)
- **2:00 AM**: Late Night Recovery (1)

### **Resource Allocation & Scaling**
- **Cloud Run**: Auto-scaling based on demand (up to 100 concurrent executions)
- **Workflows**: Stateless execution with efficient timeout management
- **Storage**: Automatic GCS scaling for raw data + status files
- **Pub/Sub**: Event-driven processing (decoupled from workflow execution)
- **Status Tracking**: Lightweight JSON files with automatic lifecycle management

### **Future Optimization Opportunities**
- **Smart Recovery**: Upgrade to Option 2 selective retry when API limits tighten
- **Predictive Scheduling**: Adjust timing based on actual game schedules
- **Dynamic Timeouts**: Adjust scraper timeouts based on historical performance
- **Parallel Recovery**: Run recovery scrapers in parallel when dependencies allow
