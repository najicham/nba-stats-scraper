## 🏗️ Backfill Architecture Strategy

### **Schedule-Driven Processing (Master Innovation)**

**Why Schedule-First Approach:**
- **No wasted API calls** on off-days (no games scheduled)
- **Automatic playoff inclusion** - schedule contains everything
- **Game metadata** available - regular season vs playoffs, postponements
- **Efficient resource usage** - only process dates with actual games
- **Natural boundaries** - seasons have clear start/end dates

**NBA.com Schedule API Structure:**
```yaml
URL Pattern: "https://data.nba.com/data/10s/v2015/json/mobile_teams/nba/{YEAR}/league/00_full_schedule.json"

Key Data Points:
- Game ID (gid): "0022100001" (matches other APIs)
- Game Date (gdte): "2021-10-19"
- Teams: Away/Home with abbreviations
- Arena: Location and details
- Playoff Series Info: "MIL wins series 4-2"
- Game Status: "Final", "Scheduled", etc.
```

## 🎯 5-Scraper Backfill Strategy

### **Critical Scrapers for Historical Analysis:**

#### **1. Odds API Events Historical** ⭐ **FOUNDATION**
- **Purpose:** Get historical event IDs for specific dates
- **Dependency:** **MUST RUN FIRST** - provides event_ids for Props API
- **API:** Historical Events endpoint with date parameter
- **Output:** Event IDs, game metadata, sportsbook availability
- **Business Value:** Foundation for all prop betting data

#### **2. Odds API Props Historical** ⭐ **CORE BUSINESS**
- **Purpose:** Historical player points props with closing lines
- **Dependency:** **Requires event_ids from Events API**
- **Strategy:** **Closing lines only** (2-4 hours before game start)
- **API:** Historical Props endpoint with event_id parameter
- **Output:** Player prop odds, lines, sportsbook prices
- **Business Value:** **Primary revenue data** - historical betting market

#### **3. Ball Don't Lie Box Scores** ⭐ **STATISTICAL FOUNDATION**
- **Purpose:** Player points and comprehensive game statistics
- **Parameters:** Single date (API limitation)
- **API Rate Limit:** 600 requests/minute (generous for backfill)
- **Output:** Player stats, team stats, injury status, active rosters
- **Business Value:** **Actual performance vs prop lines** comparison

#### **4. Big Data Ball Play-by-Play** ⭐ **ALREADY COMPLETE**
- **Status:** **3,962 files organized and uploaded to GCS**
- **Purpose:** Enhanced analytics with lineup tracking
- **Coverage:** Complete 2021-2024 seasons with playoffs
- **Data Quality:** 40+ fields per event, ~500-800 events per game
- **Business Value:** Advanced context for prop performance analysis

#### **5. NBA.com Schedule API** ⭐ **MASTER CALENDAR**
- **Purpose:** Season structure with playoff information
- **Frequency:** **Once per season** (4 total API calls)
- **Output:** Complete game calendar with metadata
- **Business Value:** **Drives entire backfill process** efficiently

---

## 🔄 Workflow Execution Strategy

### **Phase 1: Schedule Collection (Foundation)**
```yaml
Workflow: collect-season-schedules
Duration: ~5 minutes
API Calls: 4 total

Process:
1. Collect NBA.com schedules for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024
2. Parse JSON for game dates, IDs, playoff information
3. Create master game calendar: season_game_calendar.json
4. Store in GCS for backfill workflow consumption

Output: Master calendar of ~5,200 games with metadata
```

### **Phase 2: Historical Data Backfill (Main Process)**
```yaml
Workflow: backfill-historical-data
Duration: 1-2 weeks (conservative, rate-limited)
API Calls: ~5,200 total across multiple APIs

Input Parameters:
- seasons: ["2021-22", "2022-23", "2023-24"]
- include_playoffs: true
- resume_from_date: null (checkpoint capability)
- scrapers_to_run: ["all"]

Daily Process (for each game date):
1. Odds API Events Historical (date) → extract event_ids
2. Odds API Props Historical (event_ids) → get closing props
3. BDL Box Scores (date) → get player statistics  
4. Verify Big Data Ball files exist for date
5. Cross-validate data completeness
6. Write checkpoint for resume capability
7. Generate daily data quality report

Execution Strategy:
- Process dates sequentially (resume capability)
- Built-in rate limiting respect
- Comprehensive error handling
- Data validation at each step
```

## 📊 API Usage and Rate Limiting

### **Ball Don't Lie API**
- **Rate Limit:** 600 requests/minute
- **Usage:** ~1,300 requests (one per game date)
- **Timeline:** Can complete in 1-2 days if run continuously
- **Strategy:** Conservative batch processing with delays

### **Odds API**
- **Rate Limit:** 500 requests/month (paid plan)
- **Usage:** ~2,600 requests (Events + Props for each game)
- **Timeline:** Spread across 5-6 months or multiple API keys
- **Strategy:** High-value data collection, consider rate limit expansion

### **NBA.com APIs**
- **Rate Limit:** No official limit, reasonable usage
- **Usage:** 4 requests total (season schedules)
- **Timeline:** Immediate completion
- **Strategy:** Foundation data collection first

---

## 🔍 Data Validation and Quality Strategy

### **Cross-Validation Points:**
1. **Game Existence:** Every scheduled game has data from all sources
2. **Player Validation:** Players in box scores exist in roster data
3. **Points Consistency:** BDL points vs NBA.com points (±1 point tolerance)
4. **Date Alignment:** All sources agree on game dates and timing
5. **Props-to-Performance:** Historical props have corresponding actual stats

### **Halt and Investigate Triggers:**
- **Missing Games:** Any scheduled game without data from primary sources
- **Statistical Anomalies:** Player points differ by >2 between sources
- **Roster Mismatches:** Player in box score but not in season roster
- **Odds Orphans:** Props without corresponding game data
- **File Corruption:** Big Data Ball files unreadable or incomplete

### **Data Quality Reports:**
```yaml
Daily Quality Metrics:
- Games processed: X/Y for date
- API success rates: Events (X%), Props (X%), BDL (X%)
- Cross-validation pass rate: X%
- Data completeness score: X%
- Files written: X games, Y MB

Weekly Summary:
- Total games processed: X
- Data quality score: X%
- API usage tracking
- Error pattern analysis
- Resume checkpoint status
```
