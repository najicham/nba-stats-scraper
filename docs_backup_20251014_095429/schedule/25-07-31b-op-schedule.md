## Business Rules & Dependencies

### **Critical Dependencies**
1. **Events â†’ Props Dependency**: 
   - `nba-odds-events` MUST complete before `nba-odds-props` runs
   - 30-minute timing window: Events at :00, Props at :30
   - **Business Impact**: Props API will fail without valid event IDs

2. **Player Intelligence Requirement**:
   - `nba-player-list` required for prop processing
   - Maps player names to team abbreviations
   - **Business Impact**: Cannot process prop bets without player-team mapping

3. **Sequential Post-Game Processing**:
   - 5-minute stagger prevents resource conflicts
   - Allows each scraper to complete before next starts

### **API Rate Limits**
| API | Limit | Current Usage | Monitor |
|-----|-------|---------------|---------|
| Ball Don't Lie | 600 requests/minute | ~15-20/day | âœ… Under limit |
| Odds API | 500 requests/month | ~60-80/month | âœ… Under limit |
| NBA.com | No official limit | ~40-50/day | Monitor for blocking |
| ESPN | No official limit | ~25-30/day | Monitor for blocking |

### **Resource Management**
- **Cloud Run Timeout**: 5 minutes per scraper
- **Memory**: 512MB standard, 1GB for large files
- **Concurrency**: Max 3 instances per scraper
- **Retry Policy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
