"""
Walk-Forward Experiment Infrastructure for CatBoost V8

This module provides tools for running walk-forward validation experiments
to understand optimal training strategies for the CatBoost V8 model.

Key modules:
- train_walkforward.py: Train models with configurable date ranges
- evaluate_model.py: Evaluate models on out-of-sample data

See docs/08-projects/current/catboost-v8-performance-analysis/WALK-FORWARD-EXPERIMENT-PLAN.md
for experiment definitions and methodology.
