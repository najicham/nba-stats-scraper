## üéØ Season-by-Season Coverage

### 2021-22 Season: ‚ùå NO DATA

**Status:** Complete season missing  
**Coverage:** 0% (0 of 1,327 games)

#### Details
- **Regular Season:** 0 of 1,234 games (0%)
- **Playoffs:** 0 of 93 games (0%)

#### Root Cause
Historical scraper for player props not built until 2023. The Odds API historical endpoint may not have data this far back, or scraper was not operational during this period.

#### Business Impact
- No historical baseline for 2021-22 season
- Cannot analyze player prop trends from this season
- Focus analysis on 2023-24 and later

#### Backfill Feasibility
üî¥ **Not Possible** - Data not available in The Odds API historical endpoint for this period

---

### 2022-23 Season: ‚ùå MOSTLY MISSING

**Status:** Regular season missing, partial playoffs  
**Coverage:** 2.4% (31 of 1,324 games)

#### Details
- **Regular Season:** 0 of 1,234 games (0%)
- **Playoffs:** 31 of 90 games (34.4%)
  - Average players per game: 13.3
  - Min players: 11
  - Max players: 16

#### Root Cause
Historical scraper began collecting playoff data in late May 2023 (likely during NBA Finals). Regular season data not captured.

#### Known Gaps
**Missing Regular Season:** October 2022 - April 2023 (entire regular season)

**Partial Playoff Coverage:**
- **May 2023:** Some games captured
- **June 2023:** Finals games captured
- **Approximate coverage:** Conference Finals + Finals only

#### Business Impact
- No regular season baseline for 2022-23
- Limited playoff data (only late rounds)
- Cannot compare year-over-year trends 2022 vs 2023

#### Backfill Feasibility
üü° **Partial** - Playoffs may be backfillable (May-June 2023)  
üî¥ **Not Possible** - Regular season data not available

---

### 2023-24 Season: ‚úÖ GOOD (First Production Season)

**Status:** Good coverage with known early season gaps  
**Coverage:** 70.3% (944 of 1,322 games)

#### Details

**Regular Season:** 866 of 1,234 games (70.2%)
- Average players per game: 10.9
- Min players: 1
- Max players: 19

#### Known Gaps

**October - November 2023** (Season Start)
- **Period:** October 24 - November 26, 2023
- **Missing:** ~100+ games
- **Cause:** Scraper development/deployment phase

**December 2023 - April 2024** (Main Season)
- **Coverage:** ~75-80% of games
- **Missing:** ~370 games scattered throughout
- **Cause:** Normal operational gaps (scraper failures, API issues)

**April - June 2024** (Playoffs)
- **Coverage:** 88.6%
- **Missing:** 10 games
- **Cause:** Minor scraper issues

#### Business Impact
‚úÖ **First season with usable data**
- Sufficient for player prop analysis
- Good playoff coverage for high-value games
- Low coverage games (336) acceptable for non-primetime matchups

#### Backfill Feasibility
üü¢ **Possible** - Historical data available for Oct-Nov 2023 gap  
üî¥ **Not Worth It** - Scattered missing games throughout season not critical

#### Recommended Action
‚úÖ **Accept as-is** - 70% coverage sufficient for analysis  
üü° **Optional:** Backfill Oct-Nov 2023 if historical data needed

## üìà Coverage Trends

### Improvement Over Time

| Season  | Regular Season | Playoffs | Player Avg (Reg) | Player Avg (Playoff) |
|---------|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| 2021-22 | 0%             | 0%       | N/A              | N/A                  |
| 2022-23 | 0%             | 34%      | N/A              | 13.3                 |

2. **Player counts increasing:** 10.9 ‚Üí 12.2 avg players
3. **Playoff excellence:** 89% ‚Üí 92%, maintaining high player counts
4. **System maturity:** Fewer critical gaps, more consistent coverage

---

## üî¥ Critical Gaps (Require Action)

### None Currently

All critical gaps are from historical periods (2021-22, 2022-23) where data is not available for backfill. Current production system (2023-24, 2024-25) has acceptable coverage for business operations.

---

## üü° Known Acceptable Gaps

### Low Coverage Games (336 in 2023-24, 208 in 2024-25)

**Definition:** Games with <6 unique players having props

**Cause:** 
- Less interesting matchups (non-primetime games)
- Sportsbooks offering fewer props
- Not a scraper failure

**Business Impact:** 
‚úÖ **Acceptable** - These games naturally have fewer props available

**Examples:**
- Late season games for eliminated teams
- Back-to-back games (tired players)
- Injury-depleted rosters

**Action Required:** None - this is expected behavior
