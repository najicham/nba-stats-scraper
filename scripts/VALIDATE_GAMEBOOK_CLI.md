check_date | scheduled_games | gamebook_games | total_players | active_players | inactive_players | resolution_rate | status
2025-10-11 | 12              | 12             | 405           | 240            | 100              | 98.0%           | ‚úÖ Complete
```

**Status Values:**

- `‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: X games missing` - **Check which games missing**
- `‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: X games incomplete` - **Games have <25 players**
- `‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Low resolution rate` - **Below 98% target**

---

### Missing Games

```
game_date  | home_team       | away_team        | matchup    | status              | player_count
2024-11-30 | Warriors        | Suns             | PHX @ GSW  | COMPLETELY MISSING  | 0
2024-04-02 | 76ers           | Hornets          | CHA @ PHI  | INCOMPLETE DATA     | 18
```

**Action for completely missing games:**
```bash
# Create dates file from output
cat > backfill_dates.txt << EOF
2024-11-30
2024-04-02
EOF

# Run scraper backfill for those specific dates
# (Your scraper command here)
```

**Action for incomplete games:**
- Investigate why game has <25 players
- May need to reprocess that specific game

### Weekly Check

```
game_date  | day_of_week | scheduled | gamebook | total_players | avg_players | inactive | resolved | resolution_rate | status
2025-10-11 | Friday      | 12        | 12       | 405          | 33.8        | 100      | 98       | 98.0%          | ‚úÖ Complete

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: validate-gamebook"

**Problem:** Alias not set up or script not executable

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/scripts/validate-gamebook

# Use full path
~/code/nba-stats-scraper/scripts/validate-gamebook help

# Or set up alias
echo "alias validate-gamebook='~/code/nba-stats-scraper/scripts/validate-gamebook'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### "Query file not found"

**Problem:** Running from wrong directory or queries not created

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify queries exist
ls -la ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/validation/queries/raw/nbac_gamebook/

# Should see:
# season_completeness_check.sql
# find_missing_regular_season_games.sql
# name_resolution_quality.sql
# player_status_validation.sql
# daily_check_yesterday.sql
# weekly_check_last_7_days.sql
# realtime_scraper_check.sql

# Run list command to verify
validate-gamebook list
```

---

### Resolution Rate Below Target

**Problem:** Name resolution rate drops below 98.5%

**Investigation Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Get detailed problem cases
validate-gamebook resolution --csv

# 2. Check specific games
# Review CSV for patterns:
# - Specific teams having issues?
# - Specific dates with problems?
# - New players not in Basketball Reference cache?

# 3. Check processor logs
# Look for name resolution warnings/errors
```

**Common Causes:**
- G-League call-ups (expected - not in BR roster)
- Trade-pending players (expected - between teams)
- Two-way contract players (expected - may not be in cache)
- Typos in source data (rare - needs manual fix)

---

### Active Players with No Stats

**Problem:** Player marked "active" but has no points/minutes

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Run player status validation
validate-gamebook status --csv

# Review detailed quality issues section
# Check if player actually played (ESPN/BDL cross-check)
```

---

## üìÖ Recommended Schedule

### Daily (Automated via Cron)

```bash
# Add to crontab: crontab -e
0 9 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-gamebook yesterday
```

### Weekly (Manual or Automated)

```bash
# Monday mornings - full health check
validate-gamebook week
validate-gamebook resolution
```

### Monthly (Manual)

```bash
# First Monday of month - comprehensive validation
validate-gamebook completeness
validate-gamebook status
validate-gamebook resolution --table  # Save snapshot
```

### After Backfills (Manual)

```bash
# Run all four historical checks
validate-gamebook completeness
validate-gamebook missing
validate-gamebook resolution
validate-gamebook status
```

---

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Morning Check Shows Issues

```bash
$ validate-gamebook yesterday

check_date | scheduled_games | gamebook_games | resolution_rate | status
2025-10-11 | 12              | 10             | 97.8%           | ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: 2 games missing

$ validate-gamebook missing
# Identify which games are missing
# Re-run scraper/processor for those games
```

---

### Example 2: Resolution Rate Drop

```bash
$ validate-gamebook resolution

report_type         | season  | total_inactive | resolved | resolution_rate | status
SEASON RESOLUTION   | 2024-25 | 1384          | 1352     | 97.7%          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable

# Investigate problem cases
$ validate-gamebook resolution --csv

# Review CSV:
# - Check for G-League players (expected failures)
# - Check for recent trades (expected failures)
# - Look for genuine resolution issues
```

---

### Example 3: Weekly Trend Analysis

```bash
$ validate-gamebook week

game_date  | scheduled | gamebook | avg_players | resolution_rate | status
2025-10-11 | 12        | 12       | 33.8        | 98.0%          | ‚úÖ Complete
2025-10-10 | 11        | 11       | 33.6        | 97.8%          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low resolution
2025-10-09 | 0         | 0        | 0.0         | 0.0%           | ‚ö™ No games
2025-10-08 | 10        | 10       | 28.2        | 98.5%          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low player count
```

**Pattern Found:** October 8 had low average player count - investigate that specific date

---

### Example 4: Data Quality Issues

```bash
$ validate-gamebook status

STATUS SUMMARY  | active  | 1240  | 5   | 0   | 0   | 0  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues detected

# 5 active players with no points but >5 minutes playing time
# Need to cross-check with ESPN/BDL boxscores
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Chain Commands for Comprehensive Report
```bash
# Generate complete validation report
{
  echo "=== Season Completeness ==="
  validate-gamebook completeness
  echo ""
  echo "=== Name Resolution Quality ==="
  validate-gamebook resolution
  echo ""
  echo "=== Player Status Validation ==="
  validate-gamebook status
  echo ""
  echo "=== Last Week ==="
  validate-gamebook week
} > validation_report_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

### 2. Monitor Resolution Rate Trends
```bash
# Save monthly snapshots to track resolution quality over time
validate-gamebook resolution --table
```

### 3. Quick Health Check
```bash
# One-liner to verify system health
validate-gamebook yesterday && echo "‚úÖ All systems operational"
```

### 4. Alert on Critical Issues
```bash
# Add to cron job
validate-gamebook yesterday | grep -q "‚ùå" && echo "Critical issue!" | mail -s "Gamebook Alert" you@example.com
```

### 5. Find Games Needing Reprocessing
```bash
# Export missing/incomplete games for bulk reprocessing
validate-gamebook missing --csv
# Parse CSV to create reprocessing job list
```

## üéì Understanding Name Resolution

The gamebook data includes **inactive players** (injury report) with only last names:
- **Input:** "James" (last name only)
- **Resolution System:** Looks up full name using injury database + Basketball Reference rosters
- **Output:** "LeBron James" (full name for cross-table joins)

**Target:** 98.92% resolution rate (industry-leading accuracy)

**Expected Failures:**
- G-League assignments (~0.3%)
- Trade-pending players (~0.2%)
- "Not With Team" status (~0.2%)
- Two-way contracts (~0.18%)

These are **legitimate exclusions** (cannot receive prop bets), so 98.92% is effectively 100% for business purposes.
