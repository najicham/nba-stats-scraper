DIAGNOSTICS | 5278    | null_playoff_flag | 0           | 0          | 0               | 360            | 4918  | Check: all should be 0

```
check_date | scheduled_games | odds_games | games_with_spreads | games_with_totals | status
2025-10-11 | 12              | 12         | 12                 | 12                | ‚úÖ Complete
```

```bash
# Create dates file from output
cat > backfill_dates.txt << EOF
2021-11-30
2022-04-02
EOF

# Run scraper backfill
python -m backfill_jobs.scrapers.odds_api_lines.odds_api_lines_backfill_job \
  --dates-file backfill_dates.txt --force
```

### Playoff Verification

```
team                 | expected_games | actual_games | actual_spreads | actual_totals | missing_games | status
Boston Celtics       | 24             | 24           | 24             | 24            | 0             | ‚úÖ Complete
