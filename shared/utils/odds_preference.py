Odds API Game Lines - Bookmaker Preference Utilities

Provides convenient Python functions for querying game lines with
DraftKings preferred and FanDuel as fallback.

Coverage Stats (Oct 2021 â†’ Mar 2025):
- Total games: 5,260
- DraftKings: 5,235 games (99.52%)
- FanDuel fallback: 25 games (0.48%)

Usage:
    from shared.utils.odds_preference import get_preferred_game_lines, get_game_lines_summary
    
    # Get all lines for a date
    lines = get_preferred_game_lines('2024-01-24')
