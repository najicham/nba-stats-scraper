# Advanced/Complex operations (include only when needed)

# All your existing complex targets can go here:
# - build-prod, deploy-staging, test-integration
# - db-reset, infra-destroy, emergency-reset
# - monitoring, debugging, etc.

# Include this file in main Makefile when you need the complexity
