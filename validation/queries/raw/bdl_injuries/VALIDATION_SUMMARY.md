## 🎯 What This Validates

### Current Data State (No Historical Backfill)
- ✅ Daily scraper runs successfully
- ✅ Data is fresh (< 2 hours old)
- ✅ Reasonable injury counts (20-60 typical)
- ✅ Good team coverage (15-25 teams)
- ✅ Perfect parsing quality (1.0 confidence)
- ✅ Return dates parsed correctly

### What This Does NOT Validate
- ❌ Historical data (BDL only provides current injuries)
- ❌ 4-season backfills (not applicable)
- ❌ Game-by-game coverage (not game-dependent)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Make CLI Tool Executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/validate-bdl-injuries
```

### 2. Test on Current Data (August Test Data)
```bash
# Check what data exists
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT * FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.bdl_injuries\`
LIMIT 10;
"

# Run validation
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries daily
```

### 3. Set Up for Season Start (October 2025)
```bash
# Add to daily workflow
crontab -e

# Add: Run at 9 AM daily during season
0 9 * * * /path/to/scripts/validate-bdl-injuries daily
```

---

## 📅 When to Use Each Query

### 3. Cross-Validate When Needed
- Check against NBA.com injuries
- Verify with BDL active players
- Confirm with team news

### 4. Monitor Parsing Quality
- 1.0 confidence is excellent
- Drops below 0.9 need investigation
- Return date parsing should be 95%+

### 5. Season Context Matters

- Pre-season: Light data normal
- Regular season: 20-60 injuries
