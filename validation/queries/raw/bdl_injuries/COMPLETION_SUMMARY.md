## 🐛 Issue Found & Documented

### Duplicate Records in Test Data

**Problem:**
- Aug 22 data has 230 records (should be 115)
- Every player inserted exactly twice
- Same timestamp, same source file
- Processor bug, not validation bug

**Impact on Validation:** ✅ None - queries handle it correctly with `COUNT(DISTINCT)`

**Fix Required:** YES - Before season starts

**Documentation:** `processors/PROCESSOR_FIX_bdl_injuries.md`

**Action Items:**
1. ✅ Documented full fix specification
2. ⏳ Pass to processor team for implementation
3. ⏳ Test fix on Aug 22 data
4. ⏳ Verify result: 115 records (not 230)

---

## 🧪 Test Results

### Query Testing (on August 2025 data)

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Basic data query | ✅ PASS | 345 records, 115 unique players, 29 teams |
| Quality check | ✅ PASS | Fixed division by zero with SAFE_DIVIDE |
| Confidence monitoring | ✅ PASS | Shows 1.0 confidence (excellent!) |
| Weekly check | ✅ PASS | Correct 7-day analysis |
| Realtime check | ✅ PASS | Correctly identifies no current data |
| Daily check | ✅ PASS | Correctly shows CRITICAL for missing data |
| Duplicate handling | ✅ PASS | All queries use DISTINCT appropriately |

### CLI Tool Testing

```bash
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries daily      # ✅ Works
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries weekly     # ✅ Works
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries confidence # ✅ Works
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries quality    # ✅ Works (after fix)
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries realtime   # ✅ Works
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries all        # ✅ Works
```

- ⚪ EXPECTED: Off-season (no false alerts)

### ✅ Production Ready Features

**Handles Edge Cases:**
- Off-season (Jul-Sep): No false alerts
- Playoffs (Apr-Jun): Adjusted team count expectations
- Sparse data: Understands empty days are normal for injuries
- Duplicate records: Queries use DISTINCT appropriately

**Performance:**
- All queries run in < 5 seconds
- Optimized for partition filtering
- Uses SAFE_DIVIDE to prevent errors
- Efficient DISTINCT usage

**Maintainability:**
- Clear query structure

## 📊 Expected Behavior When Season Starts

### October 22, 2025 - Season Opener

**First Day:**
```bash
# After scraper runs, you'll see:
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries daily

# Expected output:
✅ Complete: Good coverage
injuries: 35
unique_players: 35
unique_teams: 18
avg_confidence: 1.0
```

### Daily Operations (Oct-Jun)

**Automated:**
- Cron runs validation at 9 AM PT
- Logs saved to `logs/validation/`
- Alerts sent if issues found
- Weekly reports on Mondays

**Manual (only if alerts):**
- Review logs
- Run diagnostics
- Fix issues
- Verify resolution

### Off-Season (Jul-Sep)

**Expected:**
```bash
./scripts/validate-bdl-injuries daily

# Output:
⚪ Expected: Off-season - no scraper run
```

**Status:** All normal, no action needed
