-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_injuries/data_quality_check.sql
-- Purpose: Comprehensive data quality validation for BDL injuries
-- Usage: Run weekly or when investigating data anomalies
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - 29-30 teams should appear in dataset over time
--   - Reasonable distribution of injury statuses
--   - High return date parsing success
--   - Minimal data quality flags
