-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_referee/official_count_validation.sql
-- Purpose: Validate correct number of officials per game (3 regular, 4 playoff)
-- Usage: Run to identify games with incorrect official assignments
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Regular season games should have exactly 3 officials
--   - Playoff games should have exactly 4 officials
--   - Any deviations indicate data quality issues
