-- BDL Standings Find Missing Dates
-- Purpose: Identify specific dates without standings during NBA season
-- Expected: Daily snapshots October-June, sparse July-September
-- Run: When gaps detected, for creating backfill lists
-- ============================================================================
--
-- INSTRUCTIONS:
-- 1. Update date range below for season being checked (lines 23-24)
-- 2. Run query to identify missing dates
-- 3. Export results to create scraper backfill list
