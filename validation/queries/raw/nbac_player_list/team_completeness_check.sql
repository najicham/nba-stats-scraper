-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/team_completeness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Verify all 30 teams present with reasonable player counts
-- Usage: Run regularly to detect missing teams or unusual roster sizes
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. All 30 NBA teams should be present
--   2. Each team should have ~13-17 active players (normal range)
--   3. Alert if any team missing or has <10 or >20 active players
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - 30 teams total
--   - Active player count: 13-17 per team (typical)
--   - Inactive players: 0-3 per team (normal)
--   - Large deviations indicate data quality issues
-- ============================================================================
