-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/data_freshness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Verify player list is being updated regularly (current-state table)
-- Usage: Run daily to ensure scraper/processor are functioning
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Schedule to run daily at ~9 AM (after morning scraper completes)
--   2. Alert if status != "‚úÖ Fresh" or hours_since_update > 36
--   3. No parameters needed - checks current state automatically
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - last_update within 24 hours = "‚úÖ Fresh"
--   - last_update 24-36 hours = "‚ö†Ô∏è Stale"
--   - last_update >36 hours = "üî¥ CRITICAL"
--   - All 30 teams present with ~13-17 active players each
-- ============================================================================
