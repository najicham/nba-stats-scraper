# NBA.com Player List Validation - Testing Guide

**File:** `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/TESTING_GUIDE.md`

Step-by-step guide for testing the validation queries.

## Prerequisites

Before testing:
- [ ] All query files saved in `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/`
- [ ] CLI tool installed and executable
- [ ] BigQuery access working (`bq ls` succeeds)
- [ ] `jq` installed for CLI tool

## Testing Phase 1: Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP!)

### Test 1.1: Date Range & Volume

**Purpose:** Understand what data exists in the table

```bash
cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/discovery_date_range.sql
```

**Expected Results:**
```
earliest_seen:       2024-XX-XX (or earlier)
latest_seen:         2025-10-13 (today or yesterday)
last_processed_timestamp: Recent timestamp
total_records:       ~600
unique_players:      ~600
unique_teams:        30
active_players:      ~390-550
null_teams:          0
```

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ùå `latest_seen` more than 2 days old ‚Üí Data not updating!
- ‚ùå `unique_teams` ‚â† 30 ‚Üí Missing teams
- ‚ùå `null_teams` > 0 ‚Üí Data quality issue
- ‚ùå `active_players` < 300 or > 700 ‚Üí Unusual

**Action if failing:** Stop and investigate data source before continuing

---

### Test 1.2: Team Distribution

**Purpose:** Verify all 30 teams with reasonable player counts

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/discovery_team_distribution.sql
```

**Expected Results:**
- 30 rows (one per team)
- Each team: 13-17 total_players (typical)
- Each team: 13-17 active_players
- Recent `newest_update` dates (last 24 hours)

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ùå < 30 teams ‚Üí Missing teams!
- ‚ùå Any team with < 10 or > 20 players ‚Üí Investigate
- ‚ùå Old `newest_update` ‚Üí Specific team not updating

---

### Test 1.3: Duplicate Detection

**Purpose:** Check for primary key violations

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/discovery_duplicates.sql
```

**Expected Results:**
```
(Zero rows returned)
```

**If you see ANY rows:**
- üö® **CRITICAL**: Primary key violation!
- Must be fixed before proceeding
- Check processor deduplication logic

- ‚úÖ 0 duplicates on player_lookup
- ‚úÖ CLI tool functional

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "jq: command not found"
```bash
brew install jq  # Mac
sudo apt-get install jq  # Linux
```

### "Query file not found"
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
pwd  # Should show nba-stats-scraper root
ls -la validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/
```

### "Permission denied"
```bash
chmod +x scripts/validate-player-list
```

### No color output
Terminal might not support ANSI colors. Use `--csv` instead:
```bash
./scripts/validate-player-list daily --csv
```

### BigQuery authentication issues
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project nba-props-platform
bq ls  # Test connection
```

## Next Steps After Testing

1. ‚úÖ **All tests pass** ‚Üí Set up daily monitoring
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Some warnings** ‚Üí Investigate and document
3. ‚ùå **Critical errors** ‚Üí Fix data source issues first

## Daily Monitoring Setup

After successful testing:
```bash
# Add to crontab (runs at 9 AM daily)
crontab -e

# Add this line:
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-player-list daily >> /var/log/player_list_validation.log 2>&1
```
