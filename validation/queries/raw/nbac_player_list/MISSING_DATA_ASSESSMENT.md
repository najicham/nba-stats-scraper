## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Freshness Issue (Not Missing Data)

**Last Update:** October 3, 2025 (10 days ago)  
**Expected:** Daily updates during season  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **STALE** (not missing, just not recent)

**Impact:**
- Data exists and is complete
- Data is valid for October 3, 2025 rosters
- Needs refresh for current rosters

**Likely Cause:**
- üèÄ NBA Preseason (October 2025) - rosters may be frozen
- üìÖ Scraper may be paused until regular season starts
- üîß Or scraper needs to be activated

**Action Required:**
- Verify scraper schedule for regular season
- Confirm scraper will activate October 22, 2025 (season opener)
- No data backfill needed - current snapshot is complete

---

## Historical Data Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** `nbac_player_list_current` is a **current-state only** table.

**What this means:**
- NO historical data expected
- Table replaced daily with latest roster
- Cannot validate "past 4 seasons"
- By design: only current season (2025) data

**For historical roster data, use:**
- `nba_raw.br_rosters_current` - 4 seasons (2021-2025)
- `nba_raw.nbac_gamebook_player_stats` - Game-by-game history

3. Monitor for roster cuts reflected
4. Validate BDL cross-comparison

### üîß Scraper Schedule Verification
- Confirm scraper configured for regular season
- Verify it will activate October 22, 2025
- Check processor runs after scraper completes

### üìä Validation Schedule
**Preseason (Now - Oct 21):**
- Weekly checks (rosters may be frozen)
- Monitor for any updates

**Regular Season (Oct 22+):**
- **Daily checks** at 9 AM
- Alert if >24 hours since update
- Monitor team counts and player changes
