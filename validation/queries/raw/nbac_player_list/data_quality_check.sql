-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_list/data_quality_check.sql
-- Purpose: Comprehensive data quality validation for player list
-- Usage: Run regularly to detect duplicates, NULLs, and data integrity issues
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. All quality checks should return 0 issues
--   2. Any non-zero counts require investigation
--   3. Duplicates on player_lookup are CRITICAL (primary key violation)
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All checks should show "âœ… Pass" status
--   - Duplicate player_lookup: 0
--   - NULL critical fields: 0
--   - Invalid data: 0
-- ============================================================================
