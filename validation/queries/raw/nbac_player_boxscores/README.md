# NBA.com Player Boxscores Validation Queries

**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Deployed (Awaiting Season Data)  
**Processor:** NbacPlayerBoxscoreProcessor  
**Table:** `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.nbac_player_boxscores`  
**Pattern:** Pattern 3 (Game-Based Single Event) - Similar to BDL Boxscores

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Table is Currently Empty

This validation suite is **production-ready** and waiting for NBA season data. The processor is deployed and validated, but the scraper only runs during actual NBA games. All queries are designed to:
- Handle empty table gracefully (no errors)
- Work immediately once season starts
- Provide "no data yet" messaging

## Overview

NBA.com Player Boxscores provide **official NBA statistics** for all active players in each game. This is the authoritative source of truth for player performance data and serves as the primary validation source for other box score data (BDL, ESPN).

### Key Features

**Official NBA Data:**
- Authoritative `nba_player_id` for cross-source linking
- Enhanced metrics (True Shooting %, Usage Rate, etc.) - *coming soon*
- Quarter-by-quarter breakdowns - *coming soon*
- Plus/minus ratings
- Flagrant and technical foul tracking

**Active Players Only:**
- ~30-35 players per game
- No DNP (Did Not Play) records
- No inactive players
- Starter flag for rotation analysis

**Critical Cross-Validation:**

## Current Status & Timeline

### Now (Pre-Season)
- ‚úÖ Processor deployed and validated
- ‚úÖ All validation queries created and tested
- ‚ö™ Table empty (awaiting season start)
- ‚ö™ All queries return "No data yet" messages

### Season Start (Expected October 2024)
- üîÑ Scraper begins collecting data
- üîÑ First games processed
- üîÑ Validation queries start reporting real results
- üîÑ Daily monitoring begins

### Expected Backfill Scope
Once season starts and historical data becomes available:
- **2024-25 season:** ~1,230 regular season + playoffs
- **Historical seasons:** Potentially 2021-2025 (4 seasons)
- **Total records:** ~165,000 player-game records (matching BDL)
- **Processing time:** 90-120 minutes for full backfill

## Enhanced Features Coming Soon

Currently **NULL** but planned for future implementation:

### Advanced Metrics
- `true_shooting_pct` - True Shooting Percentage
- `effective_fg_pct` - Effective Field Goal Percentage  
- `usage_rate` - Usage Rate
- `offensive_rating` - Offensive Rating

- `points_ot` - Overtime points

**Monitoring:** Run `data_quality_checks.sql` weekly to track when these features become available.

## Cross-Source Validation Strategy

### Primary Validation: NBA.com vs BDL

**Both sources should show:**
- Same games covered (95%+ overlap)
- Same players per game (within 1-2 players)
- Identical core stats (points, assists, rebounds)

**When discrepancies occur:**
1. NBA.com is official source of truth
2. Document discrepancy in validation log
3. Investigate if discrepancy >2 points (CRITICAL)
4. Update BDL if NBA.com data is correct

### Validation Hierarchy
1. **NBA.com** (this source) - Official, authoritative
2. **BDL** - Primary comparison, usually matches
3. **ESPN** - Backup validation when needed

## Alert Thresholds

### Critical (Immediate Action Required)
- ‚ùå No data for scheduled games
- üî¥ Point discrepancies >2 points vs BDL
- ‚ùå Multiple games missing from daily check

### Warning (Investigate Within 24 Hours)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any point discrepancy vs BDL
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing games (1-2)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unusual player/starter counts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Major stat discrepancies vs BDL

### Info (Monitor)
- üü° Minor differences in rebounds/assists
- üü° Players in NBA.com but not BDL (expected)
- ‚ö™ Enhanced metrics not yet available

## Troubleshooting

### Query returns "No data yet"
‚úÖ **This is normal before season starts!** Queries are designed to handle empty table gracefully.

### After season starts, still no data
1. Check scraper logs: Is it running during games?
2. Check processor logs: Are files being processed?
3. Verify GCS paths: `gs://nba-scraped-data/nba-com/player-boxscores/`
4. Run `daily_check_yesterday.sql` for detailed status

### Discrepancies with BDL
1. Run `cross_validate_with_bdl.sql`
2. NBA.com is source of truth - BDL may have errors
3. Document discrepancies >2 points
4. Investigate if pattern emerges (specific team, date range)

### Missing games
1. Run `find_missing_games.sql` for specifics
2. Check scraper logs for those dates
3. Verify games actually occurred (check schedule)
4. Create backfill plan if needed
