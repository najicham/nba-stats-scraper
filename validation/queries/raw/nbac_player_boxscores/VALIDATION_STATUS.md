## ✅ Validations Completed

### 1. Data Integrity ✅
**Query Run:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_players,
  COUNT(DISTINCT nba_player_id) as unique_player_ids,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN nba_player_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_player_ids,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN points IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_points,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN total_rebounds IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_rebounds
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.nbac_player_boxscores`
WHERE game_date = "2024-10-29"
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS
- 88 players with unique IDs
- 0 missing player_ids
- 0 missing points
- 0 missing rebounds

### 2. Coverage Validation ✅
**Comparison:** Schedule vs Scraped Data

| Source | Games | Match |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Schedule (nbac_schedule) | 4 games | ✅ |
| Scraped (nbac_player_boxscores) | 4 games | ✅ |
| **Coverage** | **100%** | ✅ |

**Games Matched:**
- DEN @ BKN ✅
- DAL @ MIN ✅
- SAC @ UTA ✅
- NOP @ GSW ✅

```

**Result:** ✅ PASS - 0 rows (no critical NULLs)

## ⚠️ Validations NOT Yet Run

### 1. Cross-Validation with BDL ⚪ NOT RUN
**Status:** No BDL data available for 2024-10-29  
**Query:** `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_boxscores/cross_validate_with_bdl.sql`  
**Result:** ⚪ No Data Available

**To Run This:**
1. Scrape BDL data for matching dates
2. Re-run cross-validation query
3. Look for point discrepancies >2

**Expected Result:** 95%+ stats should match between NBA.com and BDL

---

### 2. Season Completeness ⚪ NOT RUN
**Status:** Only 1 day of data  
**Query:** `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_boxscores/season_completeness_check.sql`

**Current State:** Would show 1 game for most teams (incomplete)

**To Run This:**
- Need full season data (Oct 2024 - Apr 2025)
- Expected: ~82 games per team for regular season

---

### 3. Historical Back-to-Back Detection ⚪ NOT RUN
**Status:** Need multiple consecutive days  
**Requires:** At least 7-14 days of data

**To Test:**
```sql
-- Check for games on consecutive days
SELECT 
  team_abbr,
  game_date,
  LAG(game_date) OVER (PARTITION BY team_abbr ORDER BY game_date) as prev_game
FROM nbac_player_boxscores
WHERE game_date BETWEEN '2024-10-22' AND '2024-11-01'
```

---

### 4. Weekly Trends ⚪ NOT RUN
**Query:** `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_boxscores/weekly_check_last_7_days.sql`  
**Status:** Need 7 days of data

**Current:** Would only show 1 day

---

### 5. Missing Games Detection ⚪ NOT RUN
**Query:** `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_boxscores/find_missing_games.sql`  
**Status:** Can run, but limited value with 1 day

**To Run:**
```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_boxscores/find_missing_games.sql
```

---

### 6. Playoff Completeness ⚪ NOT APPLICABLE
**Query:** `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_boxscores/verify_playoff_completeness.sql`  
**Status:** No playoff data (regular season only)

**Will be needed:** April-June 2025 (playoffs)

---

### 7. Data Quality Checks (Advanced) ⚪ NOT RUN
**Query:** `validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_boxscores/data_quality_checks.sql`  
**Status:** Can run, but some features not available

**Current Limitations:**
- No enhanced metrics (TS%, Usage Rate) - expected NULL
- No quarter breakdowns - expected NULL
- No starter flags - not in leaguegamelog format
- No jersey numbers - not in leaguegamelog format

---

## 🚀 Future Validation Tasks

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)
1. **Scrape 5-7 more dates** (2024-10-23 to 2024-10-28)
   - Validates pipeline consistency
   - Enables weekly trend checks
   - Tests back-to-back detection

2. **Run weekly check query**
   - Once we have 7 days of data
   - Look for patterns in data capture

3. **Compare with ESPN/other sources** (manual spot check)
   - Pick 3-5 players
   - Verify stats match official NBA stats

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
4. **Scrape full October 2024**
   - Oct 22 - Oct 31 (season start)
   - ~150 games total
   - Enables month-level validation

5. **Set up BDL scraping for same dates**
   - Enable cross-validation
   - Critical for prop bet accuracy

6. **Run season completeness check**
   - Once we have 2+ weeks of data
   - Check team game counts

### Medium-term (Next Month)
7. **Full season backfill** (if needed)
   - Oct 2024 - current date
   - ~1,500 games
   - Comprehensive historical data

8. **Set up automated daily validation**
   - Run daily_check_yesterday.sql every morning
   - Alert on failures
   - Monitor data quality trends

9. **Playoff data preparation**
   - Update queries for playoff season
   - Different validation rules (series-based)

### Long-term (Ongoing)
10. **Performance monitoring**
    - Track scraper success rate
    - Monitor processing times
    - Alert on anomalies

11. **Enhanced metrics research**
    - Investigate if leaguegamelog can provide TS%, Usage
    - May need different API endpoint
    - Document limitations

12. **Cross-source reconciliation**
    - NBA.com vs BDL vs ESPN
    - Document known discrepancies
    - Establish "source of truth" hierarchy

## 🔍 Known Limitations

### Data Source Limitations (leaguegamelog API)
The NBA.com `stats.nba.com/stats/leaguegamelog` endpoint we use has these limitations:

**Missing Fields:**
- ❌ Starter flag (not available)
- ❌ Jersey numbers (not available)
- ❌ Position (not available)
- ❌ Enhanced metrics: TS%, Usage%, PIE (not in this endpoint)
- ❌ Quarter breakdowns (not in this endpoint)
- ❌ Technical/Flagrant fouls (not in this endpoint)
- ❌ Team scores (game-level data not in player log)

**Available Fields:**
- ✅ All basic stats (pts, reb, ast, stl, blk, etc.)
- ✅ Plus/minus
- ✅ Shooting percentages (FG%, 3P%, FT%)
- ✅ Official NBA player IDs
- ✅ Minutes played

**Impact:** These missing fields are set to NULL in BigQuery. This is **expected and acceptable** for our use case (player points props).

### Alternative for Missing Fields
If enhanced metrics are needed, consider:
- Different API endpoint (boxscoretraditionalv2, boxscoreadvancedv2)
- Would require new scraper
- Document in future improvements
