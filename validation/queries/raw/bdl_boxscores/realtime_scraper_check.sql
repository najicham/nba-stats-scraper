-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_boxscores/realtime_scraper_check.sql
-- Purpose: Real-time check to verify scraper is running for today's games
-- Usage: Run during game days to monitor live data collection
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Run this query after games complete (typically 11 PM - 1 AM ET)
--   2. Check if completed games have box score data
--   3. Alert if completed games missing data
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Completed games should have box score data within 30-90 minutes
--   - In-progress games may not have data yet (normal)
--   - Scheduled games should not have data (normal)
