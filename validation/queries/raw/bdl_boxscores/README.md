## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Teams show <82 games
**Solution:**
1. Run `find_missing_games.sql` to identify specific dates
2. Check GCS for missing scraper files
3. Re-run scraper for missing dates
4. Re-run processor for those dates

### Issue: Low player counts (<20 per game)
**Solution:**
1. Check `cross_validate_with_gamebook.sql` for discrepancies
2. Verify scraper captured full game data
3. Check processor logs for parsing errors
4. Compare with NBA.com gamebook as source of truth

### Issue: Point discrepancies with gamebook
**Solution:**
1. Review `cross_validate_with_gamebook.sql` results
2. Check if discrepancy is systematic (all games) or isolated
3. Verify BDL API hasn't changed response format
4. Re-scrape and re-process affected games

### Issue: Missing playoff games
**Solution:**
1. Run `verify_playoff_completeness.sql`
2. Confirm scraper ran for playoff dates (April-June)
3. Check if scraper excludes playoffs (should include!)
4. Backfill missing playoff dates

## üîÑ Validation Workflow

### Initial Backfill
```bash
# 1. Run season completeness
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < season_completeness_check.sql

# 2. If issues found, identify missing games
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < find_missing_games.sql

# 3. After fixes, verify playoffs
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < verify_playoff_completeness.sql

# 4. Cross-validate with official source
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < cross_validate_with_gamebook.sql
```

### Daily Production
```bash
# Morning (9 AM)
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < daily_check_yesterday.sql

# Alert if not "‚úÖ Complete"
```

### Weekly Review
```bash
# Monday morning
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < weekly_check_last_7_days.sql
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < cross_validate_with_gamebook.sql
```

## üìù Updating Queries for New Seasons

When a new season starts, update these date ranges:

### Season Completeness Check
```sql
-- Line 24-27: Add new season
WHEN b.game_date BETWEEN '2025-10-21' AND '2026-06-20' THEN '2025-26'
```

### Find Missing Games
```sql
-- Lines 17-18: Update for season being checked
WHERE s.game_date BETWEEN '2025-10-21' AND '2026-04-20'
```

### Verify Playoff Completeness
```sql
-- Line 17: Update playoff period
WHERE game_date BETWEEN '2025-04-19' AND '2025-06-20'
```

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Healthy System
- Season completeness: All teams 82/82 regular season
- Daily check: "‚úÖ Complete" every game day
- Weekly check: All days ‚úÖ or ‚ö™ (no games)
- Cross-validation: Zero or minimal point discrepancies
- Playoff verification: All playoff teams ‚úÖ Complete

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention
- Teams with 80-81 games (investigate specific dates)
- Point discrepancies 1-2 points (monitor, may be OK)
- Occasional daily check warnings (transient issues)

### ‚ùå Critical Issues
- Teams with <80 games (systematic scraper failure)
- Point discrepancies >2 points (data quality issue)
- Multiple consecutive daily check failures (scraper down)
- Missing playoff games (revenue-impacting)
