-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_boxscores/cross_validate_with_gamebook.sql
-- Purpose: Compare BDL stats against NBA.com official gamebook (source of truth)
-- Usage: Run weekly to verify data quality and identify discrepancies
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Most players should show "âœ… Match" for all stats
--   - Points discrepancies are CRITICAL (affect prop settlement)
--   - Assists/rebounds discrepancies are concerning but less critical
--   - Missing players should be investigated
-- ============================================================================
