-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_boxscores/cross_validate_with_gamebook.sql
-- Purpose: Compare BDL box scores with NBA.com gamebook for data quality
-- Usage: Run to detect discrepancies between sources
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Update date range to check specific period
--   2. Adjust point_diff_threshold if needed (default: 2 points)
--   3. Results show players with stat discrepancies between sources
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Empty or minimal results = data sources agree
--   - Large point_diff = investigate scraper/processor issues
--   - Missing players = one source has incomplete data
-- ============================================================================
