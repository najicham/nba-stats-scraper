-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 
-- Most days: "‚ö™ NO ESPN DATA (Normal for backup source)"
-- This is EXPECTED and CORRECT behavior
--
-- ESPN is a sparse backup source that only collects data during:
-- - Early Morning Final Check workflow failures
-- - Manual backup validation scenarios
-- - Ad-hoc data quality checks
--
-- STATUS GUIDE:
-- ‚ö™ No ESPN Data = Normal (backup source, not daily collection)
-- ‚úÖ ESPN + BDL = Excellent (both sources for validation)
-- üî¥ ESPN Only = Investigate (why no BDL data?)
-- 
-- CRITICAL: Do NOT alert on "no ESPN data" - this is expected behavior
-- ONLY alert if ESPN exists but BDL doesn't (role reversal = problem)
