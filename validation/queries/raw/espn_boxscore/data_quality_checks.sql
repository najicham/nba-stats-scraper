-- ============================================================================
-- EXPECTED RESULTS (as of Oct 2025):
-- 
-- Total Games: 1 (single game in dataset)
-- All Quality Checks: ‚úÖ Pass (ESPN data is high quality)
--
-- QUALITY THRESHOLDS:
-- üî¥ CRITICAL Issues:
--   - NULL points values (core stat missing)
--   - Wrong team count (‚â†2 teams per game)
--   - Player count <15 per game
--
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING Issues:
--   - Player count 15-19 or >35 (unusual but possible)
--   - Missing rebounds/assists (nice to have)
--   - Unbalanced teams (<8 players one side)
--
-- ‚ö™ NORMAL Patterns:
--   - DNP players with no minutes
--   - 50+ point games (rare but valid)
--   - 20+ rebound games (rare but valid)
