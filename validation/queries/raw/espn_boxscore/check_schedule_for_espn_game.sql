-- Check if the ESPN-only game exists in schedule
-- Run this AFTER identify_espn_only_game.sql to get game details
-- 
-- INSTRUCTIONS:
-- 1. Run identify_espn_only_game.sql first to get: game_date, home_team, away_team
-- 2. Update the three values below with those results
-- 3. Then run this query
-- ============================================================================

-- TODO: UPDATE THESE VALUES with results from identify_espn_only_game.sql
-- Game found: 2025-01-15, HOU @ PHI
-- So the values should be:
