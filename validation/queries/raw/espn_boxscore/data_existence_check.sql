-- ============================================================================
-- EXPECTED RESULTS (as of Oct 2025):
-- 
-- Total Games: 1 (extremely sparse - backup source only)
-- Date Range: 2025-01-15 to 2025-01-15
-- Recent Activity: Minimal (backup collection is ad-hoc)
-- Player Count: ~25 per game (20-30 expected)
-- Quality: High when data exists
--
-- STATUS INTERPRETATION:
-- ‚ö™ MINIMAL coverage = NORMAL for backup source
-- ‚úÖ GOOD quality = Expected when data exists
-- 
-- CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:
-- ESPN is a sparse backup source. Low game counts are EXPECTED and NORMAL.
-- This is NOT a completeness check - it's an existence verification.
