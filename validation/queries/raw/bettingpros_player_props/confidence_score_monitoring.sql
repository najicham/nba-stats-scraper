-- File: validation/queries/raw/bettingpros_player_props/confidence_score_monitoring.sql
-- Purpose: Monitor BettingPros validation confidence scores by date
-- Usage: Run to understand data freshness and betting relevance
-- ============================================================================
-- Confidence Score Meanings:
--   0.95 = Same-day games (maximum betting confidence)
--   0.70 = Games within 1 month (high relevance)
--   0.30 = Games within 1 year (trend analysis)
--   0.10 = Games >1 year old (historical analysis only)
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Recent dates should have primarily 0.95 confidence
--   - Historical dates should show 0.1-0.3 confidence
--   - Sudden drops may indicate processing timing issues
