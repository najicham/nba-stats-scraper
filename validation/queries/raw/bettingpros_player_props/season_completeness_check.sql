-- File: validation/queries/raw/bettingpros_player_props/season_completeness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Team-by-team season validation for BettingPros player props
-- Usage: Run after backfills to verify team coverage across all seasons
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - DIAGNOSTICS row should show confidence distribution
--   - Each team should have games_with_props > 0
--   - Regular season avg: 40-60 props/game (varies by bookmaker coverage)
--   - Playoffs avg: 40-50 props/game (more focused coverage)
-- ============================================================================
-- Key Differences from Odds API:
--   - Tracks validation_confidence scores (0.1, 0.3, 0.95)
--   - No game_id field - uses date + team matching
--   - Variable bookmaker coverage (20 active sportsbooks)
