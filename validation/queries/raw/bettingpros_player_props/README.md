- Playoffs: 40-50 props per game average
- Confidence scores should match data recency

**Run**:
```bash
./scripts/validate-bettingpros completeness
./scripts/validate-bettingpros completeness --csv  # Save to CSV
```

### 2. Daily Check Yesterday
**File**: `daily_check_yesterday.sql`

### 3. Find Missing Games
**File**: `find_missing_games.sql`  
**Alias**: `missing`, `gaps`, `dates`

Identifies specific dates with zero or suspiciously low props coverage.

**Expected Results**:
- Empty result = perfect coverage
- Lists dates needing rescraping
- Flags dates with <50 total records

**Run**:
```bash
./scripts/validate-bettingpros missing
```

**Note**: Edit the date range in the SQL file for specific seasons:
```sql

## üîç Understanding Validation Results

### Diagnostic Checks (Season Completeness)

The query outputs three sections:

**1. DIAGNOSTICS Row**:
```
row_type: DIAGNOSTICS
info1: total_dates (should be ~839)
info2: null_playoff (should be 0 - means schedule join failed)
info3: avg_confidence (0.6-0.7 is normal across all history)
info4: unique_books (should be ~20)
```

**2. CONFIDENCE Distribution**:
```
Conf=0.95: 1,087,315 records (49.9%) - Recent data
Conf=0.30: 383,782 records (17.6%) - 2024-25 season
Conf=0.10: 708,399 records (32.5%) - Historical 2021-2023
```

**3. TEAM Stats**:
```
info1: reg_games (regular season games with props)
info2: reg_avg_props (average props per game)
info3: playoff_games (playoff games with props)
info4: playoff_avg_props (playoff props per game)
```

### Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ **Complete/Good**: Data meets expectations
- üü° **WARNING**: Potential issue, review recommended
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Data missing or severely degraded

**Common Issues**:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ‚ùå No games | Team has 0 props data | Check scraper for this team |
| üü° Low coverage | <30 props/game | Review bookmaker participation |
| üî¥ No high-confidence | All records are historical | Check processing timing |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Low bookmaker coverage | <10 bookmakers | API issues or market changes |

## üìà Expected Metrics by Season

### Regular Season
- **Games per team**: 82 games
- **Props per game**: 30-60 (varies by bookmaker coverage)
- **Players per game**: 100-240 unique players across all games that day
- **Bookmakers**: 15-20 active sportsbooks
- **Confidence**: 0.95 for same-day, 0.1-0.3 for historical

### Playoffs
- **Games per team**: 4-28 (varies by playoff run)
- **Props per game**: 40-50 (more focused coverage)
- **Players per game**: 15-20 per game (star players)
- **Bookmakers**: 15-20 active sportsbooks
- **Confidence**: Should be 0.95 for recent playoffs

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Query Returns Empty Results

**Problem**: No rows returned from validation query.

**Solutions**:
1. Check date range in SQL file matches your data
2. Verify table name: `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.bettingpros_player_points_props`
3. Run discovery query to confirm data exists:
```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
SELECT MIN(game_date), MAX(game_date), COUNT(*) 
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.bettingpros_player_points_props`
'
```

### High Percentage of Low Confidence

**Problem**: Most records show 0.1 or 0.3 confidence.

**Explanation**: This is NORMAL for historical data. BettingPros uses freshness-based confidence:
- Data >1 year old = 0.1 confidence (historical analysis only)
- Data within 1 year = 0.3 confidence (trend analysis)
- Recent/same-day = 0.7-0.95 confidence (betting relevance)

**Action**: Focus validation on high-confidence data (‚â•0.7) for daily operations.

### Missing Dates Detected

**Problem**: Season completeness shows games without props.

**Solutions**:
1. Run `find_missing_games.sql` to get specific dates
2. Check if scraper ran on those dates
3. Re-run scraper for missing dates
4. Verify in GCS: `gs://nba-scraped-data/bettingpros/player-props/points/`

### Low Bookmaker Coverage

**Problem**: Fewer than 10 bookmakers per day.

**Possible Causes**:
- API rate limits or throttling
- Bookmaker markets closed
- BettingPros source data issues
- Scraper configuration problems

**Action**: Run `bookmaker_coverage_analysis.sql` to see which books are missing.

## üìä Cross-Validation with Other Sources

BettingPros data should be compared with:

### Odds API Player Props
```sql
-- Compare line coverage
SELECT 
  o.game_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.player_lookup) as odds_api_players,
  COUNT(DISTINCT b.player_lookup) as bettingpros_players
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.odds_api_player_points_props` o
FULL OUTER JOIN `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.bettingpros_player_points_props` b
  ON o.game_date = b.game_date
WHERE o.game_date >= '2024-10-22'
GROUP BY o.game_date
ORDER BY o.game_date DESC;
```

### Expected Differences
- **Player Coverage**: BettingPros may have more players (20 bookmakers vs 2-3 in Odds API)
- **Lines**: Different bookmakers = different line values
- **Timing**: BettingPros captures ~2 hours before tipoff (single snapshot)

## üîê BigQuery Partition Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All queries MUST include game_date filter for partition elimination.

```sql
-- ‚úÖ CORRECT
WHERE game_date >= '2024-10-22'

-- ‚ùå WRONG - Will be slow and expensive
WHERE player_lookup = 'lebronjames'
```

All validation queries already include proper partition filters.

## üìÖ Maintenance Schedule

### Daily (During Season)
- Run `yesterday` check every morning
- Alert on ‚ùå or üî¥ status

### Weekly
- Run `week` check to monitor trends
- Review confidence scores
- Check bookmaker participation

### Monthly
- Run full `completeness` check
- Verify bookmaker coverage hasn't dropped
- Review any low-coverage games

### Post-Season
- Run `playoffs` verification
- Archive validation results
- Update date ranges for next season

## üéì Key Learnings from BettingPros Data

### Confidence Scoring is Business-Critical
- Don't treat all records equally
- Filter for high-confidence (‚â•0.7) in daily operations
- Historical low-confidence data is still valuable for analysis

### Bookmaker Coverage Varies
- Not all 20 bookmakers appear in every game
- Coverage increases for high-profile games
- Playoff games have more consistent coverage

### No Game ID Field
- Join on game_date + team matching
- Can't cross-validate individual games as precisely
- Date-level validation is sufficient

### Variable Record Counts
- Regular season: 3,500-8,000 records per day (multiple games)
- Playoffs: 700-850 records per game
- This is NORMAL - don't flag as missing

## üìû Support

### Issues?
1. Check troubleshooting section above
2. Review query comments for expected results
3. Run discovery queries to understand your data
4. Verify date ranges match your backfill

### Extending Validation
To add new queries:
1. Create SQL file in `validation/queries/raw/bettingpros_player_props/`
2. Add command alias to `validate-bettingpros` CLI tool
3. Update this README with query documentation
4. Test with `--csv` output first
