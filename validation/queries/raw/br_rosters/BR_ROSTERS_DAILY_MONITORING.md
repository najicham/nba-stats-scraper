## Daily Monitoring Workflow

### Morning Routine (9:00 AM PT)

**Step 1: Check Yesterday's Roster Updates**

```bash
cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/br_rosters/daily_check_yesterday.sql
```

**What to Look For:**

‚úÖ **Normal Results:**
```
status = "‚úÖ No roster changes"      ‚Üí Most common (no trades/signings)
status = "‚úÖ Normal changes"         ‚Üí 1-5 new players (expected)
status = "‚ö™ No scraper run"         ‚Üí Offseason or scraper didn't run
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Investigate:**
```
status = "‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple changes"       ‚Üí >5 new players
  ‚Üí Review the new player list below the summary
  ‚Üí Cross-check with ESPN/NBA.com for trades
  ‚Üí Normal during trade deadline (Feb 8), but unusual other times
```

**Example Normal Output:**
```
check_date  | season  | teams_updated | players_updated | new_players | status
2025-10-23  | 2024-25 | 30            | 655            | 2           | ‚úÖ Normal changes

NEW_PLAYER rows:
2025-10-23  | NEW_PLAYER | 0 | 0 | 0 | LAL: Christian Wood (C)
2025-10-23  | NEW_PLAYER | 0 | 0 | 0 | BOS: Dalano Banton (G)
```

**Action Items:**
- If status = "‚ö™ No scraper run" during season ‚Üí Check scraper logs
- If status = "‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple changes" ‚Üí Verify trades on ESPN.com
- Log any new players for prop betting impact analysis

---

### Weekly Review (Monday 9:00 AM PT)

**Step 2: Review Last Week's Activity**

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/br_rosters/weekly_check_last_7_days.sql
```

**What to Look For:**

‚úÖ **Healthy Pattern:**
```
Most days: status = "‚úÖ No changes"
Occasional: status = "‚úÖ Normal changes"
Scraper runs: 7/7 days during season
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Problem Patterns:**
```
Multiple days: status = "‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple changes"
  ‚Üí Trade deadline period (Feb 6-8) = EXPECTED
  ‚Üí Other times = Investigate unusual activity

Multiple days: status = "‚ö™ No scraper run"
  ‚Üí During season = CRITICAL (scraper failed)
  ‚Üí During offseason = EXPECTED (scraper paused)
```

**Example Healthy Output:**
```
check_date | day_of_week | teams_updated | players_updated | new_players | changes | status
2025-10-20 | Monday      | 30            | 655            | 0           |         | ‚úÖ No changes
2025-10-21 | Tuesday     | 30            | 656            | 1           | LAL:... | ‚úÖ Normal changes
2025-10-22 | Wednesday   | 30            | 656            | 0           |         | ‚úÖ No changes
...
```

**Action Items:**
- Scraper down 2+ days ‚Üí Restart scraper and backfill missing days
- Trade spike ‚Üí Document for prop betting team (player availability changes)
- No activity for 7 days during season ‚Üí Verify Basketball Reference website accessibility

---

### As-Needed: Scraper Health Check

**Step 3: Check Scraper Freshness (When Investigating Issues)**

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/br_rosters/realtime_scraper_check.sql
```

**What to Look For:**

‚úÖ **Healthy Scraper (During Season):**
```
status = "‚úÖ Scraper ran today"           ‚Üí Perfect
status = "‚úÖ Scraper healthy (yesterday)" ‚Üí Acceptable
days_since_scrape = 0 or 1
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning (During Season):**
```
status = "‚ö†Ô∏è Scraper stale (check logs)"
days_since_scrape = 2-7
  ‚Üí Action: Check Cloud Scheduler execution history
  ‚Üí Verify scraper logs in Cloud Run
```

‚ùå **Critical (During Season):**
```
status = "‚ùå CRITICAL: Scraper down during season"
days_since_scrape > 7
  ‚Üí Action: IMMEDIATE - Restart scraper
  ‚Üí Backfill missing dates
  ‚Üí Alert engineering team
```

‚úÖ **Expected (During Offseason):**
```
status = "‚ö™ Offseason - scraper idle (expected)"
days_since_scrape > 7 (June-September)
  ‚Üí No action needed - normal behavior
```

**Example Output:**
```
check_date | check_timestamp      | season  | most_recent_scrape | days_since | status
2025-10-23 | 2025-10-23 09:15:00  | 2024-25 | 2025-10-23        | 0          | ‚úÖ Scraper ran today
```

**Action Items:**
- days_since_scrape > 2 during season ‚Üí Investigate immediately
- days_since_scrape > 7 during season ‚Üí CRITICAL - restart and backfill

        )
```

## Seasonal Preparation

### Before Season Starts (September 2025)

**Step 1: Update Season Configuration**

Update `current_season` CTE in these files:
- `daily_check_yesterday.sql`
- `weekly_check_last_7_days.sql`
- `realtime_scraper_check.sql`

```sql
-- Change from:
SELECT 2024 as season_year, '2024-25' as season_display

-- To:
SELECT 2025 as season_year, '2025-26' as season_display
```

**Step 2: Add New Season to Completeness Check**

Update `season_completeness_check.sql`:

```sql
CASE
  WHEN game_date BETWEEN '2021-10-19' AND '2022-06-20' THEN '2021-22'
  WHEN game_date BETWEEN '2022-10-18' AND '2023-06-20' THEN '2022-23'
  WHEN game_date BETWEEN '2023-10-24' AND '2024-06-20' THEN '2023-24'
  WHEN game_date BETWEEN '2024-10-22' AND '2025-06-20' THEN '2024-25'
  WHEN game_date BETWEEN '2025-10-21' AND '2026-06-20' THEN '2025-26'  -- ADD THIS
END as season
```

**Step 3: Test Scraper**

```bash
# Test scraper on first preseason game
python -m scrapers.basketball_reference.br_season_roster --season 2025 --teams LAL

# Verify data loaded
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT * FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.br_rosters_current\`
WHERE season_year = 2025
LIMIT 5
"
```

**Step 4: Enable Daily Monitoring**

```bash
# Verify cron jobs are active
crontab -l | grep br_rosters

# Test daily check manually
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/br_rosters/daily_check_yesterday.sql
```

---

## Trade Deadline Period (February 6-8, 2026)

**Special Considerations:**

During the 3-day trade deadline window, expect:
- **10-30 new players per day** (NORMAL)
- **Multiple roster updates per team** (NORMAL)
- **Increased scraper frequency** (may need hourly scraping)

**Monitoring Adjustments:**

```bash
# Increase check frequency to every 2 hours
0 */2 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && \
  bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/br_rosters/realtime_scraper_check.sql
```

**Daily Summary:**

```bash
# End-of-day trade deadline summary (11 PM PT)
0 6 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && \
  bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
  SELECT 
    last_scraped_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_full_name) as players_added_today,
    STRING_AGG(CONCAT(team_abbrev, ': ', player_full_name), ', ' ORDER BY team_abbrev) as new_players
  FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.br_rosters_current\`
  WHERE first_seen_date = CURRENT_DATE() - 1
    AND season_year = 2025
  GROUP BY last_scraped_date
  " | mail -s "Trade Deadline Summary" your-email@example.com
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Scraper Not Running

**Symptoms:**
- `realtime_scraper_check.sql` shows days_since_scrape > 2
- `daily_check_yesterday.sql` shows "‚ö™ No scraper run"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check Cloud Scheduler
gcloud scheduler jobs describe br-season-roster-scraper --location=us-west2

# Check recent runs
gcloud scheduler jobs executions list br-season-roster-scraper --location=us-west2 --limit=5
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manual trigger
gcloud scheduler jobs run br-season-roster-scraper --location=us-west2

# Or run scraper directly
python -m scrapers.basketball_reference.br_season_roster --season 2025
```

---

### Issue 2: Missing Teams After Scraper Run

**Symptoms:**
- `daily_check_yesterday.sql` shows teams_updated < 30
- `find_missing_teams.sql` returns results

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check which teams are missing
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < validation/queries/raw/br_rosters/find_missing_teams.sql
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-scrape specific teams
python -m scrapers.basketball_reference.br_season_roster \
  --season 2025 \
  --teams LAL BOS GSW  # Add missing teams

# Or re-scrape all teams
python -m scrapers.basketball_reference.br_season_roster --season 2025
```

---

### Issue 3: Data Quality Degradation

**Symptoms:**
- `data_quality_check.sql` shows new nulls in critical fields
- Name normalization failures

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Find specific problem records
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT *
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.br_rosters_current\`
WHERE season_year = 2025
  AND (player_lookup IS NULL OR team_abbrev IS NULL)
LIMIT 10
"
```

**Solution:**
- Review processor logs for errors
- Check if Basketball Reference changed HTML structure
- Update scraper/processor code if needed
- Re-process affected dates

---

### Issue 4: Duplicate Players

**Symptoms:**
- Same player appears multiple times for same team-season
- `season_completeness_check.sql` shows player_count != roster_spots

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Find duplicates
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT 
  season_year,
  team_abbrev,
  player_full_name,
  COUNT(*) as occurrences
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.br_rosters_current\`
WHERE season_year = 2025
GROUP BY season_year, team_abbrev, player_full_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
"
```

**Solution:**
- Check processor MERGE logic
- Review deduplication strategy
- May need to clean data manually and re-process
