| **birth_date** | 2,640 (100%) | Not on BR roster pages | ✅ Expected |
| **college** | 2,640 (100%) | Not on BR roster pages | ✅ Expected |

| **jersey_number** | 0 | Populated on all rosters | ✅ Good |
| **height** | 0 | Populated on all rosters | ✅ Good |
| **weight** | 0 | Populated on all rosters | ✅ Good |

---

## Position Distribution

| Position | Total Occurrences | Unique Players | Status |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| **SG** | 647 | 285 | ✅ Normal |
| **SF** | 525 | 248 | ✅ Normal |
| **PF** | 494 | 214 | ✅ Normal |
| **PG** | 491 | 193 | ✅ Normal |
| **C** | 483 | 174 | ✅ Normal |

All positions show reasonable distribution across 4 seasons.

---

## Trade Activity Analysis

### Multi-Team Players (Normal - Trades)

| Season | Total Traded | 2 Teams | 3 Teams | 4+ Teams |
|--------|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| 2021-22 | 97 | 85 | 11 | 1 |
| 2022-23 | 71 | 71 | 0 | 0 |
| 2023-24 | 78 | 71 | 7 | 0 |
| 2024-25 | 82 | 78 | 4 | 0 |

**Analysis:** Trade activity is NORMAL and expected. Players appearing on multiple teams represent legitimate mid-season trades, signings, and roster moves.

---

## Outliers & Edge Cases

### Teams with Unusual Roster Sizes

Only **1 legitimate outlier** identified:

| Season | Team | Players | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| 2023-24 | MEM | 33 | High injury rate + 10-day contracts = Expected |

**All other teams fall within normal range (13-32 players).**

---

## Missing Data Analysis

### ✅ No Missing Roster Data

**Validation Method:** `find_missing_teams.sql`
**Result:** Empty (0 rows)
**Interpretation:** All 120 expected team-season combinations are present

**Missing Team-Season Combinations:** None
**Missing Games:** N/A (not game-based data)
**Missing Players:** None detected

### Expected Null Fields (Not Data Issues)

The following fields are NULL because **Basketball Reference roster pages don't provide this biographical data:**

1. **birth_date** - 100% null (2,640/2,640)
2. **college** - 100% null (2,640/2,640)
3. **experience_years** - 100% null (2,640/2,640)

**These are NOT data quality issues.** Basketball Reference season roster pages only show:
- Player names
- Positions
- Jersey numbers
- Height/weight
- Team affiliation

Biographical data would need to be scraped from individual player pages (out of scope).

---

## Data Freshness

| Field | Date | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **First Seen Date (Earliest)** | 2025-09-19 | ✅ Recent backfill |
| **Last Scraped Date (Latest)** | 2025-09-19 | ✅ All current |
| **All Records Same Date** | Yes | ✅ Consistent backfill |

All records show `first_seen_date = last_scraped_date = 2025-09-19`, indicating a successful historical backfill completed on that date.

---

## Cross-Validation with Other Data Sources

### Potential Cross-Checks

These rosters can be cross-validated against:

1. **NBA.com Player List** (`nba_raw.nbac_player_list_current`)
   - Current team assignments
   - Active/inactive status
   - Cross-check player names

2. **Ball Don't Lie Active Players** (`nba_raw.bdl_active_players_current`)
   - Alternative active roster source
   - Validate team assignments

3. **NBA Gamebooks** (`nba_raw.nbac_gamebook_player_stats`)
   - Historical game appearances
   - Validate player-team-season relationships

4. **Player Box Scores** (`nba_raw.bdl_player_boxscores`)
   - Game-by-game appearances
   - Confirm roster membership

**Recommendation:** Periodically run cross-validation queries to ensure consistency across sources.

## Known Limitations

1. **End-of-Season Snapshots**
   - These are NOT current rosters
   - Show ALL players who appeared during season
   - Not real-time roster updates

2. **Missing Biographical Data**
   - No birth dates (scrape player pages for this)
   - No college info (scrape player pages for this)
   - No experience years (scrape player pages for this)

3. **Historical Data Only**
   - Currently covers 2021-22 through 2024-25
   - Need to add 2025-26 when season starts
   - Older seasons (pre-2021) not backfilled
