-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_movement/data_quality_checks.sql
-- Purpose: Comprehensive data quality validation (NULLs, duplicates, orphans)
-- Usage: Run after backfills or when investigating data integrity issues
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All critical fields should be non-NULL
--   - No duplicate primary keys (would indicate INSERT_NEW_ONLY failure)
--   - No orphaned non-player transactions outside trades
-- ============================================================================
