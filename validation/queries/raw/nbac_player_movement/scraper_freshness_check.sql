-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_movement/scraper_freshness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Check when data was last scraped/inserted with seasonal context
-- Usage: Run daily to monitor scraper health (with appropriate expectations)
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Status interpretation depends on season (see seasonal_context)
--   - Green (‚úÖ) = scraper healthy for this time of year
--   - Yellow (üü°) = worth checking but may be normal
--   - Red (‚ùå/üî¥) = investigate immediately
