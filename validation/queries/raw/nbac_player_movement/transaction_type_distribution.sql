-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_movement/transaction_type_distribution.sql
-- Purpose: Verify transaction type ratios match expected distributions
-- Usage: Run monthly to detect data quality issues in transaction types
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Signing: ~47% (most common, includes re-signings and new contracts)
--   - Waive: ~31% (teams releasing players)
--   - Trade: ~20% (includes multi-part trades)
--   - ContractConverted: ~1.6% (two-way to standard conversions)
--   - AwardOnWaivers: ~0.6% (claiming players off waivers)
