-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_movement/recent_activity_check.sql
-- Purpose: View recent transaction activity (last 30 days)
-- Usage: Run weekly or when monitoring current season activity
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - During free agency (July-August): Expect daily activity
--   - During trade deadline (February): Expect frequent updates
--   - During playoffs (May-June): Minimal activity is normal
--   - Off-season: No activity for weeks is expected
