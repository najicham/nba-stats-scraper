-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_player_movement/team_activity_check.sql
-- Purpose: Verify all 30 teams have reasonable transaction activity
-- Usage: Run monthly or when investigating specific team data issues
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All 30 teams should appear in recent seasons
--   - Teams with 0 transactions in current season = data issue
--   - Teams with <5 transactions in full season = investigate
-- ============================================================================
