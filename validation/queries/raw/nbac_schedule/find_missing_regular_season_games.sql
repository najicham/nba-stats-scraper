-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_schedule/find_missing_regular_season_games.sql
-- Purpose: Detect patterns of missing regular season games by analyzing team game counts
-- Usage: Run when season_completeness_check shows teams with unusual counts
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Update the date range for the season you're checking
--   2. Run the query to see teams with unusual game counts
--   3. Review daily gaps to identify specific missing date ranges
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Empty team_gaps = all teams have similar game counts
--   - Empty daily_gaps = consistent game scheduling throughout season
--   - Non-empty results indicate missing data or unusual scheduling
-- ============================================================================
