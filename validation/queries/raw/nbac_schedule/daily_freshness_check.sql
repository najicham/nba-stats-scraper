-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_schedule/daily_freshness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Daily morning check to verify yesterday's games are in schedule
-- Usage: Run every morning as part of automated monitoring
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Schedule this to run daily at ~9 AM (after scraper/processor complete)
--   2. Set up alerts for status != "‚úÖ Complete" or "‚úÖ No games scheduled"
--   3. No date parameters needed - automatically checks yesterday
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - status = "‚úÖ Complete" when yesterday's games present
--   - status = "‚úÖ No games scheduled" on off days (All-Star break, etc.)
--   - status = "‚ùå CRITICAL" requires immediate investigation
-- ============================================================================
