## üìä Understanding Output

### Season Completeness Check

```
row_type    | season  | team | regular_season | playoffs | total | notes
DIAGNOSTICS | 6706    | ...  | 0              | 0        | 0     | All should be 0
TEAM        | 2024-25 | LAL  | 82             | 16       | 98    |
TEAM        | 2024-25 | LAC  | 79             | 0        | 79    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing regular season games
```

**What to Look For:**
- ‚úÖ **DIAGNOSTICS row**: All values should be 0 (no data quality issues)
- ‚úÖ **regular_season**: Should be ~82 for all teams (80-84 acceptable)
- ‚úÖ **playoffs**: Varies by team (4-28 games depending on playoff run)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes column**: Shows teams with missing games

---

### Yesterday Check

```
Date       | Games Found | Status
2025-10-11 | 12          | ‚úÖ Complete
```

**Status Values:**
- `‚úÖ Complete` - All good, no action needed
- `‚úÖ No games scheduled (expected)` - Off day or All-Star break
- `‚ùå CRITICAL: Expected games but found none` - **Data missing - investigate now**
- `üü° WARNING: Games found but missing enhanced fields` - **Data quality issue**

---

### Team Balance Check

```
team | total_games | games_diff | status
LAL  | 82          | +0.2       | ‚úÖ Normal
LAC  | 76          | -6.0       | üî¥ CRITICAL: >5 games from average
```

**What to Look For:**
- All teams should be within ~2-3 games of league average
- Large deviations (>5 games) indicate missing data
- Home/away split should be roughly equal (~41/41)

---

### Schedule Horizon

```
Furthest Game | 2025-11-15 | 34 days ahead | ‚úÖ GOOD: 3+ weeks ahead
```

**Status Values:**
- `‚úÖ GOOD: 3+ weeks ahead` - Healthy
- `‚úÖ OK: 2-3 weeks ahead` - Acceptable
- `üü° WARNING: Less than 2 weeks ahead` - **Schedule updates needed**
- `üî¥ CRITICAL: Less than 1 week ahead` - **Urgent update required**

---

### Enhanced Field Quality

```
field               | null_count | percentage | status
is_primetime        | 0          | 0.0%       | ‚úÖ
has_national_tv     | 0          | 0.0%       | ‚úÖ
primary_network     | 145        | 2.2%       | üü°
```

**What to Look For:**
- Critical fields (is_primetime, has_national_tv) should have 0% NULL
- Network fields may have ~10-20% NULL (local games without network data)
- Special events (Christmas, MLK Day) should have reasonable counts

---

### Missing Games Analysis

```
=== TEAM ANALYSIS ===
Team | Total Games | Games Diff | Status
LAC  | 76          | -6.0       | üî¥ CRITICAL: >5 games from average

=== DAILY GAPS ===
2025-11-15 | Friday  | 2 games | 5 days since last | üü° Longer gap
```

**Action Steps:**
1. Review daily gaps to identify missing date ranges
2. Check if gaps are expected (All-Star break, unusual scheduling)
3. If unexpected, check schedule scraper/processor logs

---

### Playoff Verification

```
=== PLAYOFF STRUCTURE ===
First Round     | Teams: 16 (expected 16) | Games: 80 | Per team: 4-7 games | ‚úÖ Structure OK

=== TEAM PLAYOFF RUNS ===
LAL | Lakers        | First Round ‚Üí Conference Semis ‚Üí Conference Finals ‚Üí NBA Finals | 26 games | üèÜ Finals participant
BOS | Celtics       | First Round ‚Üí Conference Semis ‚Üí Conference Finals | 19 games | üèÄ Conference Finals
LAC | Clippers      | First Round | 7 games | üìâ First Round exit
```

**What to Look For:**
- Each round should have expected team count (16 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 2)
- Series should have 4-7 games
- Team playoff runs should make sense (can't skip rounds)

---

### Team Schedule Gaps

```
=== TEAMS WITH SUSPICIOUS GAPS ===
LAC | Clippers | 76 | 3 | 8 days | üü† WARNING: Multiple 7+ day gaps

=== SPECIFIC GAPS (7+ DAYS) ===
LAC - Clippers | 2024-11-15 ‚Üí 2024-11-23 | 8 days | LAC @ DEN | üü† Suspicious gap
```

**What to Look For:**
- 7+ day gaps outside All-Star break are unusual
- Multiple 7+ day gaps indicate missing data
- Check if gaps coincide with known breaks

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: validate-schedule"

**Problem:** Alias not set up or script not executable

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/scripts/validate-schedule

# Use full path
~/code/nba-stats-scraper/scripts/validate-schedule help

# Or set up alias
echo "alias validate-schedule='~/code/nba-stats-scraper/scripts/validate-schedule'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### "Query file not found"

**Problem:** Running from wrong directory or queries not created

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify queries exist
ls -la ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/validation/queries/raw/nbac_schedule/

# Should see:
# season_completeness_check.sql
# find_missing_regular_season_games.sql
# verify_playoff_completeness.sql
# team_balance_check.sql
# team_schedule_gaps.sql
# daily_freshness_check.sql
# schedule_horizon_check.sql
# enhanced_field_quality.sql

# Run list command to verify
validate-schedule list
```

---

### "Cannot query over table without a filter on partition key"

**Problem:** Query missing required partition filter on `game_date`

**Solution:** This shouldn't happen with provided queries (all include partition filters), but if you modify queries:

```sql
-- Always include:
WHERE game_date >= 'YYYY-MM-DD'  -- Required!
```

---

## üìÖ Recommended Schedule

# Add to crontab: crontab -e
0 9 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-schedule yesterday
0 9 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-schedule horizon
```

### Weekly (Manual or Automated)

```bash
# Monday mornings

validate-schedule fields
```

### Monthly (Manual)

```bash
# First Monday of month - full health check
validate-schedule completeness
validate-schedule missing
validate-schedule balance
validate-schedule gaps
validate-schedule fields
```

### After Schedule Updates (Manual)

```bash
# Run full validation suite
validate-schedule completeness
validate-schedule balance
validate-schedule horizon
validate-schedule fields
```

### During Playoffs (Manual)

```bash
# Playoff-specific checks
validate-schedule playoffs
validate-schedule horizon
```

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Morning Check Shows Missing Games

```bash
$ validate-schedule yesterday

Date       | Games Found | Status
2025-10-11 | 0           | ‚ùå CRITICAL: Expected games but found none
```

**Actions:**
1. Check schedule scraper logs
2. Verify NBA.com API is accessible
3. Re-run schedule processor for that date
4. Verify again

---

### Example 2: Season Completeness Shows Gaps

```bash
$ validate-schedule completeness

TEAM | 2024-25 | LAC | 76 | 0 | 76 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing regular season games

# Investigate:
$ validate-schedule missing

=== TEAM ANALYSIS ===
LAC | 76 games | -6.0 from average | üî¥ CRITICAL

=== DAILY GAPS ===
2024-11-15 | 5 days since last game | üü° Longer gap
2024-12-01 | 7 days since last game | üü† Suspicious gap
```

**Actions:**
1. Note specific date ranges with gaps
2. Check if gaps are expected (schedule not released, postponements)
3. If unexpected, re-run schedule scraper for those dates
4. Verify with `validate-schedule completeness` again

---

### Example 3: Enhanced Fields Not Populated

```bash
$ validate-schedule fields

field           | null_count | percentage | status
is_primetime    | 145        | 2.2%       | üî¥
primary_network | 3200       | 48%        | üî¥
```

**Actions:**
1. Check schedule processor logs for errors
2. Verify enhanced field extraction logic
3. Re-run processor to populate fields
4. Verify with `validate-schedule fields` again

---

### Example 4: Playoff Structure Validation

```bash
$ validate-schedule playoffs

=== PLAYOFF STRUCTURE ===
First Round | Teams: 14 (expected 16) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete

=== TEAM PLAYOFF RUNS ===
# Only 14 teams listed, 2 missing
```

**Actions:**
1. Identify which teams are missing
2. Check schedule scraper for playoff games
3. Verify playoff_round field populated correctly
4. Re-run validation

```bash
# Save daily horizon checks
validate-schedule horizon --table  # Creates dated table
```

### 5. Monitor Enhanced Field Population
```bash
# Track field quality over time
validate-schedule fields --csv >> field_quality_history.csv
```
