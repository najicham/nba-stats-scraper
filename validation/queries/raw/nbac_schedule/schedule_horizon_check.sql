-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_schedule/schedule_horizon_check.sql
-- Purpose: Check how far ahead we have schedule data (freshness check)
-- Usage: Run regularly to ensure schedule updates are being captured
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. No parameters needed - automatically checks from today forward
--   2. Monitors both regular season and playoff schedule data
--   3. Alerts if we have less than 7 days of future schedule
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - During season: Should have 2-4 weeks of future schedule
--   - Off-season: May have limited data (only confirmed games)
--   - Playoffs: Schedule released series-by-series (shorter horizon normal)
-- ============================================================================
