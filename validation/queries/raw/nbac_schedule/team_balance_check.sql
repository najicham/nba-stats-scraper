-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_schedule/team_balance_check.sql
-- Purpose: Detect teams with unusual game counts (anomaly detection)
-- Usage: Run regularly to ensure all teams have similar game counts
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Update date range for the period you're checking
--   2. All teams should be within ~2-3 games of league average
--   3. Large deviations indicate missing data or unusual scheduling
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All teams should have similar total games at any point in season
--   - Each team should have ~41 home + ~41 away games
--   - Large deviations (>3 games from average) = data quality issue
-- ============================================================================
