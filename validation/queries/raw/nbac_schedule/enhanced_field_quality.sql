-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_schedule/enhanced_field_quality.sql
-- Purpose: Validate 18 enhanced analytical fields are populated correctly
-- Usage: Run after processor updates or to verify data quality
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Update date range for the period you're checking
--   2. All enhanced fields should have minimal NULL values
--   3. Special event flags should show reasonable counts
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Broadcaster fields should be populated for all games
--   - Special events (Christmas, MLK Day) should have expected counts
--   - Primetime games should be ~15-20% of total games
--   - All 30 teams should be represented
-- ============================================================================
