-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/data_quality_check.sql
-- Purpose: Comprehensive data quality validation for BDL active players
-- Usage: Run regularly to detect duplicates, NULLs, and data integrity issues
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. All quality checks should return 0 issues
--   2. Any non-zero counts require investigation
--   3. Duplicates on player_lookup or bdl_player_id are CRITICAL
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All checks should show "âœ… Pass" status
--   - Duplicate player_lookup: 0 (PRIMARY KEY violation)
--   - Duplicate bdl_player_id: 0 (unique constraint violation)
--   - NULL required fields: 0
--   - Invalid validation_status values: 0
-- ============================================================================
