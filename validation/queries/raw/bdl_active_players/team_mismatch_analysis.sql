-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/team_mismatch_analysis.sql
-- Purpose: Deep dive into validation_status = 'team_mismatch' cases
-- Usage: Run when team mismatch rate is high (>20%) to investigate
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Shows BDL team vs NBA.com team for each mismatch
--   2. Groups by team to find patterns (recent trades, timing issues)
--   3. Parses validation_details JSON for specific reasons
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - ~10-20% of players should have team mismatches
--   - Common causes: recent trades, roster timing differences
--   - Some teams may have higher mismatch rates (active trade deadline)
-- ============================================================================
