-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/daily_freshness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Daily morning check - verify BDL active players updated recently
-- Usage: Run every morning at ~9 AM as part of automated monitoring
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Schedule this to run daily after scraper/processor complete
--   2. Alert if status != "‚úÖ Updated" or update_age_hours > 48
--   3. No date parameters needed - automatically checks recent updates
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - status = "‚úÖ Updated" when data refreshed within 48 hours
--   - status = "‚ö†Ô∏è Stale" if 48-96 hours since update
--   - status = "üî¥ CRITICAL" if >96 hours since update
--   - All 30 teams should be present
--   - ~550-600 players total
-- ============================================================================
