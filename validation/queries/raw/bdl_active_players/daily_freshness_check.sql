-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/daily_freshness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Daily morning check - verify BDL active players updated recently
-- Usage: Run every morning at ~9 AM as part of automated monitoring
-- ============================================================================
-- UPDATED: Season-aware thresholds that adjust for training camp, regular season, playoffs
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - status = "‚úÖ Updated" when data refreshed within 48 hours
--   - status = "‚ö†Ô∏è Stale" if 48-96 hours since update
--   - status = "üî¥ CRITICAL" if >96 hours since update
--   - All 30 teams should be present
--   - Player counts vary by season phase:
--     * Oct-Nov (Training Camp): 620-720 players
--     * Dec-Apr (Regular Season): 540-620 players
--     * Apr-Jun (Playoffs): 450-550 players
