-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/missing_players_analysis.sql
-- Purpose: Deep dive into validation_status = 'missing_nba_com' cases
-- Usage: Run when missing rate is high (>30%) to investigate
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Shows players in BDL but NOT in NBA.com
--   2. Expected: G-League players, two-way contracts, recent signings
--   3. Parse validation_details for specific reasons
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - ~20-30% of players should be missing from NBA.com
--   - Common causes: G-League assignments, two-way contracts, recent signings
--   - Some teams may have higher rates (heavy G-League usage)
-- ============================================================================
