-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/cross_validate_with_nba_com.sql
-- Purpose: Compare BDL active players against NBA.com player list
-- Usage: Run weekly to detect discrepancies between data sources
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Both sources should have similar player counts (~60-70% overlap expected)
--   2. Large discrepancies indicate data quality issues
--   3. Team mismatches highlight recent trades or roster moves
--   4. NOTE: BDL table NOT partitioned, NBA.com table IS partitioned
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - ~60-70% validated players (both sources agree)
--   - ~20-30% BDL only (expected - G-League, two-way contracts, timing)
--   - ~10-20% NBA.com only (expected - BDL may be delayed)
--   - Team mismatches: ~10-20% (trades, roster timing differences)
