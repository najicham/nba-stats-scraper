-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/player_count_check.sql
-- Purpose: Verify expected player counts across teams and validation status
-- Usage: Run daily to ensure basic data volume is correct
-- ============================================================================
-- UPDATED: Season-aware thresholds that adjust for training camp, regular season, playoffs
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results by Season Phase:
--   Training Camp (Oct-Nov):
--     - Total players: 620-720
--     - Teams found: 30
--     - Players per team: 17-26 (average ~22)
--     - Validation rate: 50%+ (higher is better!)
--   
--   Regular Season (Dec-Apr):
--     - Total players: 540-620
--     - Teams found: 30
--     - Players per team: 15-21 (average ~19)
--     - Validation rate: 55%+ (higher is better!)
--   
--   Playoffs (May-Jun):
--     - Total players: 450-550
--     - Teams found: 16-30 (decreasing as teams eliminated)
--     - Players per team: 13-18
--     - Validation rate: 60%+ (higher is better!)
