-- File: validation/queries/raw/bdl_active_players/player_count_check.sql
-- Purpose: Verify expected player counts across teams and validation status
-- Usage: Run daily to ensure basic data volume is correct
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Should find ~550-600 players across 30 teams
--   2. Each team should have 13-20 players (typical)
--   3. ~60% should be 'validated' status (healthy)
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Total players: 550-600
--   - Teams found: 30
--   - Players per team: 13-20 (average ~19)
--   - Validation rate: 55-65%
