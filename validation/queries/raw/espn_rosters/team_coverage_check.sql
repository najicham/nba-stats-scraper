-- File: validation/queries/raw/espn_rosters/team_coverage_check.sql
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Verify all 30 NBA teams have roster data
-- Usage: Run daily or after backfills to ensure complete team coverage
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Update date range to check specific period
--   2. All 30 teams should appear with 15-23 players each
--   3. Missing teams or unusual player counts indicate data issues
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All 30 teams present with player counts between 15-23
--   - Most teams have ~18-21 players (standard NBA roster + two-way)
--   - <15 or >23 players = investigate (injuries, G-League assignments, etc.)
