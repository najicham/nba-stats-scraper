-- File: validation/queries/raw/espn_rosters/cross_validate_with_nbac.sql
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Compare ESPN rosters with NBA.com Player List (primary source)
-- Usage: Run to identify discrepancies between backup and primary sources
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Compares most recent ESPN roster with NBA.com current player list
--   2. Identifies players in one source but not the other
--   3. Team mismatches indicate trades or data timing issues
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - High match rate (>90%) indicates healthy cross-validation
--   - Mismatches often due to timing (ESPN updates vs NBA.com updates)
--   - Recent trades may appear in one source before the other
-- ============================================================================
