-- File: validation/queries/raw/espn_rosters/cross_validate_suffix_aware.sql
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Compare ESPN rosters with NBA.com (accounting for suffix differences)
-- This query normalizes player_lookup to handle Jr/II/III suffix variations
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Should show >95% match rate (vs 83.9% without normalization)
--   - Remaining mismatches are genuine discrepancies
-- ============================================================================
