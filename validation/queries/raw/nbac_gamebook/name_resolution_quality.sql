-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_gamebook/name_resolution_quality.sql
-- Purpose: Analyze name resolution system performance and identify issues
-- Usage: Run after backfills or to monitor resolution quality
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Overall resolution rate ‚â•98.5% (target: 98.92%)
--   - Resolution rates consistent across seasons
--   - Few games requiring manual review
--   - Low confidence scores flagged for review
