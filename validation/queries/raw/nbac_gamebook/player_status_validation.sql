-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/nbac_gamebook/player_status_validation.sql
-- Purpose: Validate player status logic and data integrity
-- Usage: Run to detect data quality issues with player statuses and stats
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Active players should have points/stats (minutes > 0)
--   - Inactive players should NOT have stats (all NULL or 0)
--   - DNP players should NOT have playing time
--   - Player counts per game should be reasonable (~30-35 total)
