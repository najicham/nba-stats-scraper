## üîç Validation Workflow

### After Running Backfills

```bash
# 1. Check overall completeness
validate-gamebook completeness

# 2. If gaps found, identify specific games
validate-gamebook missing --csv

# 3. Verify name resolution quality
validate-gamebook resolution

# 4. Check player status logic
validate-gamebook status
```

---

### Daily Monitoring (Automated)

```bash
# Add to crontab
0 9 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-gamebook yesterday

# Manual weekly review
validate-gamebook week
```

---

### Investigating Issues

**Scenario 1: Missing Games**
```bash
validate-gamebook missing --csv
# Review CSV ‚Üí Create backfill list ‚Üí Re-run scraper
```

**Scenario 2: Low Resolution Rate**
```bash
validate-gamebook resolution --csv
# Review problem cases ‚Üí Identify patterns ‚Üí Update resolution system if needed
```

**Scenario 3: Player Status Issues**
```bash
validate-gamebook status --csv
# Review quality issues ‚Üí Cross-check with ESPN/BDL ‚Üí Fix data source if needed
```

## üéì Understanding the Data

### Player Statuses

**Active** - Played in the game
- Has minutes, points, and full stats
- Typically 10-13 players per team (20-26 per game)

**Inactive** - On injury report, did not play
- Only last name in source data (requires name resolution)
- Should have NO stats (all NULL)
- Typically 3-8 per game depending on injuries

**DNP** - Did Not Play (coach's decision)
- Full name available in source
- Should have NO playing time
- Includes "Not With Team", "G League", etc.

---

### Name Resolution System

**Challenge:** Inactive players appear with last name only (e.g., "James")

**Solution:** Multi-source resolution system:
1. **Injury Database** - Exact match on game/team/date (99%+ success)
2. **Basketball Reference** - Roster cache fallback (covers edge cases)
3. **Data-driven disambiguation** - Handles multiple matches intelligently

**Result:** 98.92% resolution rate (effectively 100% for business purposes)

**Expected Failures:** G-League assignments, trade-pending players, "Not With Team" status - these are legitimate exclusions who cannot receive prop bets.
