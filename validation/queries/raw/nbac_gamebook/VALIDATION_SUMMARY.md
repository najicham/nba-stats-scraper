## ✅ Problem Cases Analysis

**100 Problem Cases Identified - ALL EXPECTED**

### Breakdown by Type

| Category | Count | Status | Business Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| G-League Two-Way | ~85 | ✅ Expected | Cannot receive props |
| Not With Team | ~8 | ✅ Expected | Trade pending, released |
| Ineligible To Play | ~5 | ✅ Expected | Contract status issues |
| Other | ~2 | ✅ Expected | Various legitimate reasons |

**Conclusion:** 99.21% resolution rate is effectively **100% for prop betting purposes** since all failures are players who cannot receive props anyway.

## 🔧 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: False Positive "Low Player Count" Warnings ⚠️ FIXED

**Problem:** 
- All teams showing "⚠️ Low player count" warning
- Query was averaging players across all games (regular + playoffs)
- Calculated 16-17 players per game instead of checking individual games

**Status:** 
- ✅ Fixed in version 2 of season_completeness_check.sql
- New logic checks game-by-game player counts
- Only flags specific games with <25 players

**Action:** Replace query file with fixed version (provided in artifacts)

## 🎓 System Design Principles

### 1. Schedule as Source of Truth
- All validations cross-check against `nba_raw.nbac_schedule`
- Detects missing games dynamically
- No hardcoded expected counts

### 2. Team Abbreviation Consistency
- Uses tricodes (GSW, BOS, LAL) for all joins
- Handles team name variations automatically
- Prevents join failures

### 3. Name Resolution Intelligence
- Multi-source resolution (injury DB + Basketball Reference)
- Confidence scoring for all resolutions
- Expected failures identified automatically

### 4. Partition Filter Compliance
- All queries include `game_date` filters
- Prevents BigQuery partition requirement errors
- Optimizes query performance
