-- File: validation/queries/raw/odds_api_props/find_missing_games.sql
-- Purpose: Identify specific games with ZERO player props (CRITICAL issues)
-- Usage: Run when season_completeness_check shows missing games
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Update the date range for the season you're checking
--   2. Run the query
--   3. Use results to identify dates needing rescraping
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - List of games with NO props data (scraper failure)
--   - Empty result = all scheduled games have at least some props
-- ============================================================================
