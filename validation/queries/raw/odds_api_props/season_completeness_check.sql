-- File: validation/queries/raw/odds_api_props/season_completeness_check.sql
-- Purpose: Team-by-team season validation for player props
-- Usage: Run after backfills to verify team coverage
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - DIAGNOSTICS row should show 0 for null_playoff, failed_joins
--   - Each team should have games_with_props > 0
--   - Regular season avg: 6-8 players/game
--   - Playoffs avg: 8-10 players/game
