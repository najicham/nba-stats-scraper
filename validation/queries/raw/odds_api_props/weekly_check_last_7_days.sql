-- File: validation/queries/raw/odds_api_props/weekly_check_last_7_days.sql
-- Purpose: Weekly health check showing daily player props coverage trends
-- Usage: Run weekly to spot patterns and ensure consistent data capture
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Run once per week (e.g., Monday mornings)
--   2. Review for patterns (specific days with issues)
--   3. No date parameters needed - automatically checks last 7 days
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Each day should show "‚úÖ Complete" or "‚ö™ No games"
--   - Multiple "‚ö†Ô∏è Low Coverage" or "‚ùå Missing all" = scraper issue
-- ============================================================================
