-- File: validation/queries/raw/odds_api_props/verify_may_2023_coverage.sql
-- Purpose: Verify coverage from May 2023 (data collection start date)
-- Shows: 1) Date range summary, 2) Monthly coverage, 3) Specific gap dates
-- ============================================================================
-- FIXED: Corrected aggregation in gap_dates CTE
-- FIXED: Moved ORDER BY and LIMIT to end (after UNION ALL)
