-- ============================================================================
-- File: validation/queries/raw/odds_api_props/realtime_scraper_check.sql
-- Purpose: Check if today's games are being scraped in real-time
-- Usage: Run during the day to monitor active scraper health
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Run this 2-3 hours before first game of the day
--   2. Games should start appearing as scraper runs
--   3. No date parameters needed - automatically checks today
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Early morning: status = "‚è≥ Scraper not started yet" (OK)
--   - Mid-day: status = "üîÑ In Progress" with some games appearing
--   - Evening: status = "‚úÖ All games scraped" or "‚ö†Ô∏è Some missing"
-- ============================================================================
