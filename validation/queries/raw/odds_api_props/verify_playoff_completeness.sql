-- File: validation/queries/raw/odds_api_props/verify_playoff_completeness.sql
-- Purpose: Verify playoff game props coverage matches schedule
-- Usage: Run after playoffs end or during playoffs to validate data
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Update date range for the playoff period you're checking
--   2. Run the query - it automatically gets expected counts from schedule
--   3. All teams should show "‚úÖ Complete" or "‚ö†Ô∏è Low Coverage" status
-- ============================================================================
-- Note: Playoffs typically have MORE props (8-10 players) than regular season
--       This query validates both game count and player coverage
-- ============================================================================
