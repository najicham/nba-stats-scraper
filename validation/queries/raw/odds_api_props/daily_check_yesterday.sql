-- File: validation/queries/raw/odds_api_props/daily_check_yesterday.sql
-- Purpose: Daily morning check to verify yesterday's games have player props
-- Usage: Run every morning as part of automated monitoring
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Schedule this to run daily at ~9 AM (after scraper/processor complete)
--   2. Set up alerts for status != "‚úÖ Complete" or "‚úÖ No games scheduled"
--   3. No date parameters needed - automatically checks yesterday
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - status = "‚úÖ Complete" when all games have adequate props
--   - status = "‚úÖ No games scheduled" on off days
--   - status = "‚ùå CRITICAL" requires immediate investigation
