-- Purpose: Complete analysis of missing props data across 4 NBA seasons
-- Usage: Run once to get full picture of data gaps

-- This query will show you:
--   1. Overall coverage summary by season
--   2. Missing games count (games in schedule but not in props)
--   3. Low coverage games (< 6 players)
--   4. Date ranges with gaps
