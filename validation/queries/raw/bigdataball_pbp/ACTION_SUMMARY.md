---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Step 1: Save Updated Files (5 minutes)

The discovery queries and validation queries have been updated. Make sure to save the updated versions to your files:

```bash
cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/validation/queries/raw/bigdataball_pbp

# Save the DISCOVERY_FINDINGS.md from the artifact
# Save this ACTION_SUMMARY.md from the artifact

# The SQL queries are already in place but were updated in artifacts
# Re-copy these updated queries if needed:
# - discovery/discovery_query_2_event_volume.sql
# - discovery/discovery_query_3_missing_games.sql
# - discovery/discovery_query_4_date_gaps.sql
# - discovery/discovery_query_5_sequence_integrity.sql
# - season_completeness_check.sql
# - find_missing_games.sql
# - event_quality_checks.sql
```

### Step 2: Run Production Validation (10 minutes)

```bash
cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper

# Test the CLI tool
./scripts/validate-bigdataball --help

# Run season completeness check
./scripts/validate-bigdataball season

# Find specific missing games (expect 19 dates from Nov-Apr)
./scripts/validate-bigdataball missing

# Check event quality
./scripts/validate-bigdataball quality

# Check current scraper status
./scripts/validate-bigdataball realtime
```

**Expected Results:**
- Season check: 1 season (2024-25) with 1,211 games
- Missing games: 19 dates listed
- Quality: All games in normal range (400-600 events)
- Realtime: Will show "OFF DAY" (season hasn't started yet for 2025-26)

### Step 3: Investigate Missing Dates (Optional - 30 minutes)

The 19 missing dates from 2024-25 season:

```
Nov 2024: 11, 12, 14, 15, 19, 22, 26, 29
Dec 2024: 03, 10, 11, 12, 14
Jan 2025: 01
Feb 2025: 02, 14, 16 (All-Star weekend)
Mar 2025: 03
Apr 2025: 04
```

**Investigation Questions:**
1. Were games actually played on these dates? (Check NBA schedule)
2. Are the scraped files in GCS? (Check `gs://nba-scraped-data/big-data-ball/2024-25/`)
3. Did the processor run for these dates? (Check processor logs)

**Potential Causes:**
- BigDataBall didn't release data for some games (their side)
- Scraper wasn't running during those dates
- Processor failed for those specific dates
- Games were postponed/canceled

### Step 4: Set Up Daily Automation (5 minutes)

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add daily check at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-bigdataball daily >> ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/logs/bigdataball_daily.log 2>&1

# Add weekly report on Mondays at 8 AM
0 8 * * 1 cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-bigdataball weekly >> ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/logs/bigdataball_weekly.log 2>&1

# Create logs directory
mkdir -p ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/logs
```

### Step 5: Export Validation Report (Optional)

```bash
# Generate full validation report
./scripts/validate-bigdataball all > bigdataball_validation_report.txt

# Or export as CSV
./scripts/validate-bigdataball season --csv > season_validation.csv
```
