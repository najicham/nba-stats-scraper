-- BigDataBall Play-by-Play Discovery Query 2: Event Volume by Date
-- Purpose: Understand event density and identify anomalies
-- ============================================================================
-- Look for:
--   - Consistent volume across dates? (400-600 events per game expected)
--   - Any dates with suspiciously low counts?
--   - Day-of-week patterns?
-- ============================================================================
