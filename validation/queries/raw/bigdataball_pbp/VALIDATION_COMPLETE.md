## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:
1. **Discovery phase first** - Prevented false assumptions about data
2. **Pattern-based approach** - Adapted BDL queries successfully
3. **Iterative testing** - Fixed issues as they appeared
4. **Comprehensive documentation** - Everything needed is documented

### Key Insights:
1. **Game counting matters** - Must count home + away games separately
2. **Date ranges are critical** - Future dates caused false positives
3. **Thresholds need tuning** - 400 events too strict, 350 better
4. **Shot coordinates vary** - BigDataBall quality inconsistent

### For Future Validations:
1. Always run discovery queries first
2. Test with real data before finalizing
3. Document thresholds and reasoning
4. Create both backfill and monitoring guides
5. Provide complete file artifacts
