-- FILE: validation/queries/raw/bigdataball_pbp/realtime_scraper_check.sql
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Check if BigDataBall scraper/processor is running and current
-- Usage: Run to verify real-time data collection during active season
-- ============================================================================
-- Instructions:
--   1. Run anytime to check data freshness
--   2. Set up alerts if minutes_since_last > expected threshold
--   3. NOTE: BigDataBall releases data ~2 hours after game completion
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Behavior:
--   - During active games: Data appears ~2 hours after game ends
--   - Off days: May show stale data (normal)
--   - Season off: Will show months-old data (normal)
