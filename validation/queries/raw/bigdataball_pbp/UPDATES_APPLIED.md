# BigDataBall Validation - Updates Applied

**FILE:** `validation/queries/raw/bigdataball_pbp/UPDATES_APPLIED.md`

**Date:** October 13, 2025

---

## üîß Files Updated

### 1. season_completeness_check.sql ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Only counting HOME games (37-38 per team)  
**Fix:** Now counts BOTH home AND away games using UNION ALL  
**Result:** Teams now show 73-76 games (correct based on 19 missing dates)

**Key Change:**
```sql
-- Old: Only home games
FROM game_level_stats
GROUP BY season, home_team_abbr, is_playoffs

-- New: Home + Away games
FROM (
  SELECT season, home_team_abbr as team_abbr, ... FROM game_level_stats
  UNION ALL
  SELECT season, away_team_abbr as team_abbr, ... FROM game_level_stats
)
GROUP BY season, team_abbr, is_playoffs
```

---

### 2. find_missing_games.sql ‚úÖ
**Issue 1:** Showing 1,003 "missing" games (including future 2025-26 season)  
**Issue 2:** Threshold too strict (400 events flagging normal games)

**Fixes:**
1. Updated date range: `2024-10-22` to `2025-04-13` (regular season only, no future)
2. Lowered threshold: 350 events (from 400)

**Result:** Should now show ~20-30 truly missing games

**Key Changes:**
```sql
-- Old: Included future games
WHERE s.game_date BETWEEN '2024-10-22' AND '2025-06-22'

-- New: Regular season only (no playoffs, no future)
WHERE s.game_date BETWEEN '2024-10-22' AND '2025-04-13'

-- Old: Too strict
WHEN p.event_count < 400 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è LOW EVENT COUNT'

-- New: More realistic
WHEN p.event_count < 350 THEN 'üî¥ CRITICALLY LOW EVENTS'
```

---

### 3. event_quality_checks.sql ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Shot coordinate threshold too strict (70%) causing false positives

**Fixes:**
1. Lowered critical threshold: 30% (from 50%)
2. Lowered warning threshold: 50% (from 70%)
3. Event count threshold: 350/380 (from 300/400)

**Result:** More realistic quality assessment

**Key Changes:**
```sql
-- Old: Too strict
WHEN shots_with_coords * 100.0 / NULLIF(shot_events, 0) < 50 THEN 'üî¥ CRITICAL'
WHEN shots_with_coords * 100.0 / NULLIF(shot_events, 0) < 70 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING'

-- New: More realistic
WHEN shots_with_coords * 100.0 / NULLIF(shot_events, 0) < 30 THEN 'üî¥ CRITICAL'
WHEN shots_with_coords * 100.0 / NULLIF(shot_events, 0) < 50 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING'
```

---

### 4. discovery_query_3_missing_games.sql ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Also showed future 2025-26 games as "missing"  
**Fix:** Updated to match actual season dates (2024-10-22 to 2025-06-22)

---

## üìä Expected Results After Updates

### Season Completeness Check
```bash
./scripts/validate-bigdataball season
```

**Expected Output:**
- **Teams with 73-76 games** (not 82, because 19 dates are missing)
- **Regular season + Playoffs** properly categorized
- **No diagnostics errors** (null counts should be 0)

**Sample Expected:**
```json
{
  "season": "2024-25",
  "team": "BOS",
  "reg_games": "75",
  "playoff_games": "18",
  "avg_events": "468.2",
  "notes": "‚ö†Ô∏è Missing regular season games"
}
```

---

### Missing Games Query
```bash
./scripts/validate-bigdataball missing
```

**Expected Output:**
- **~20-30 games total** (not 1,003)
- **19 completely missing dates** (from discovery)
- **Maybe 1-5 low event count games** (388 events, etc.)

**Sample Expected:**
```json
{
  "game_date": "2024-11-11",
  "matchup": "SAC @ SAS",
  "status": "‚ùå MISSING COMPLETELY"
},
{
  "game_date": "2024-10-22",
  "event_count": "388",
  "status": "üî¥ CRITICALLY LOW EVENTS"
}
```

---

### Quality Checks Query
```bash
./scripts/validate-bigdataball quality
```

**Expected Output:**
- **~7 games with issues** (real data quality problems)
- **Most issues: 0% shot coordinates** (BigDataBall data problem, not ours)
- **Dates: April 2025** (playoff games missing coordinates)

**Sample Expected:**
```json
{
  "game_date": "2025-04-18",
  "game_id": "20250418_DAL_MEM",
  "pct_shots_with_coords": "0.0",
  "quality_status": "üî¥ CRITICAL: Poor coord coverage"
}
```

## üß™ Verification Steps

### Step 1: Copy Updated Files
```bash
cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper/validation/queries/raw/bigdataball_pbp

# Copy from artifacts (all updated above):
# - season_completeness_check.sql
# - find_missing_games.sql  
# - event_quality_checks.sql
# - discovery/discovery_query_3_missing_games.sql
```

### Step 2: Re-run Validation
```bash
cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper

./scripts/validate-bigdataball season > season_final.txt
./scripts/validate-bigdataball missing > missing_final.txt
./scripts/validate-bigdataball quality > quality_final.txt
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
```bash
# Should show ~75 games per team (not 37)
grep '"reg_games"' season_final.txt | head -5

# Should show ~20-30 missing games (not 1,003)
wc -l missing_final.txt

# Should show ~7 quality issues (real problems)
grep -c "‚ö†Ô∏è\|üî¥" quality_final.txt
```

**Expected:**
```
‚úÖ reg_games: 73-76 (varies by team)
‚úÖ missing games: 20-30 lines
‚úÖ quality issues: 7 games
```

## üìù Known Real Issues

After these fixes, the remaining issues are **REAL data problems**:

### 1. Missing Dates (19 total)
**Dates:** Nov 11,12,14,15,19,22,26,29; Dec 03,10,11,12,14; Jan 01; Feb 02,14,16; Mar 03; Apr 04

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Data not collected by scraper  
**Action:** Investigate scraper logs, consider backfill

### 2. Shot Coordinate Coverage (7 games)
**Games:** Playoff games Apr 15-18, 2025  
**Issue:** 0% shot coordinates in BigDataBall data  
**Status:** üî¥ BigDataBall data quality issue (their side)  
**Impact:** Can't use these games for shot analysis  
**Action:** Monitor if future playoff games have same issue

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Copy updated query files** from artifacts
2. **Re-run validation** to verify results

4. **Optional:** Investigate 19 missing dates for backfill
5. **Optional:** Contact BigDataBall about playoff shot coordinates
