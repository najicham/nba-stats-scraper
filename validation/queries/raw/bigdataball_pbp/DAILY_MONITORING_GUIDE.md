./scripts/validate-bigdataball missing
./scripts/validate-bigdataball quality

# 3. Review weekly trends (Mondays only - 2 minutes)
./scripts/validate-bigdataball weekly
```

**Expected Time:** 30 seconds/day (30 minutes if issues found)

---

## üéØ Daily Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Yesterday's Games Check

**Query:** `daily_check_yesterday.sql`  
**Command:** `./scripts/validate-bigdataball daily`  
**When:** Every morning at 9 AM (after overnight processing)

#### What It Checks:
- ‚úÖ Did yesterday's games get collected?
- ‚úÖ Are event counts in normal range (400-600)?
- ‚úÖ Is shot coordinate coverage acceptable (>70%)?
- ‚úÖ Are lineups complete (5 home + 5 away players)?

#### Expected Output:

**‚úÖ Good Day (All Clear):**
```json
{
  "check_date": "2025-10-23",
  "scheduled_games": 12,
  "games_with_data": 12,
  "avg_events_per_game": 467.3,
  "min_events_per_game": 423,
  "pct_shots_with_coords": 82.5,
  "status": "‚úÖ Complete"
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (Investigate):**
```json
{
  "check_date": "2025-10-23",
  "scheduled_games": 12,
  "games_with_data": 11,
  "min_events_per_game": 361,
  "status": "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: 1 games missing"
}
```

**‚ùå Critical (Immediate Action):**
```json
{
  "check_date": "2025-10-23",
  "scheduled_games": 12,
  "games_with_data": 0,
  "status": "‚ùå CRITICAL: No play-by-play data"
}
```

---

### Step 2: Status Interpretation

| Status | Meaning | Action Required | Priority |
|--------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| ‚úÖ Complete | All games collected, good quality | None - log success | ‚úÖ Normal |
| ‚úÖ No games scheduled | Off day (no NBA games) | None - expected | ‚ö™ Normal |
| ‚è≥ PROCESSING | Games completed <4 hours ago | Wait - BigDataBall 2hr delay | ‚ö™ Normal |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING | 1-3 games missing or low quality | Investigate specific games | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium |
| ‚ùå CRITICAL | No data or >3 games missing | Check scraper/processor immediately | üî¥ High |

---

### Step 3: Troubleshooting by Status

#### Status: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Low event count"

**Meaning:** One or more games have 380-400 events (lower than usual 450-500).

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Find which games have low events
./scripts/validate-bigdataball quality

# Check specific game
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT game_id, COUNT(*) as events
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.bigdataball_play_by_play\`
WHERE game_date = DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY game_id
ORDER BY events
"
```

**Common Causes:**
- Short game (blowout, team quit early)
- Overtime (can increase events to 550+)
- BigDataBall partial data release

**Action:**
- If >380 events: Accept (borderline normal)
- If <380 events: Investigate or flag for review
- If <350 events: Re-scrape specific game

---

#### Status: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Poor coordinate coverage"

**Meaning:** Shot coordinates <70% (shots missing X/Y positions).

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Check coordinate coverage by game
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT 
  game_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'shot' THEN 1 END) as shots,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN original_x IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as coords,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN original_x IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / 
        NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'shot' THEN 1 END), 0), 1) as pct
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.bigdataball_play_by_play\`
WHERE game_date = DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY game_id
ORDER BY pct
"
```

**Common Causes:**
- BigDataBall data quality issue (their side)
- CSV parsing error in processor
- Specific arena/camera issues

**Action:**
- If 50-70%: Accept but document
- If <50%: Contact BigDataBall or flag for manual review
- Check if specific arena/team pattern

---

#### Status: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: X games missing"

**Meaning:** 1-3 games from yesterday not in database.

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Find which games are missing
./scripts/validate-bigdataball missing | grep $(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)

# Check if files in GCS
gsutil ls gs://nba-scraped-data/big-data-ball/2024-25/$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)/
```

**Common Causes:**
- BigDataBall delayed release (wait 2-4 hours)
- Scraper failed for specific game
- Processor failed to process file
- GCS upload failure

**Action:**
1. **Wait 2 hours** (BigDataBall delay)
2. **Check scraper logs:** `grep "$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)" ~/logs/bigdataball_scraper.log`
3. **Check processor logs:** `grep "$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)" ~/logs/bigdataball_processor.log`
4. **Re-run scraper** for specific date if files not in GCS
5. **Re-run processor** if files exist but not in BigQuery

---

#### Status: "‚ùå CRITICAL: No play-by-play data"

**Meaning:** Zero games from yesterday in database.

**Investigation:**
```bash
# 1. Verify games were actually played
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT COUNT(*) as scheduled
FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_raw.nbac_schedule\`
WHERE game_date = DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
"

# 2. Check scraper logs
tail -100 ~/logs/bigdataball_scraper.log

# 3. Check processor logs  
tail -100 ~/logs/bigdataball_processor.log

# 4. Check GCS for files
gsutil ls gs://nba-scraped-data/big-data-ball/2024-25/$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)/
```

**Common Causes:**
- Scraper didn't run (cron failure, server issue)
- BigDataBall site down
- Processor crash
- BigQuery connection failure

**Action:**
1. **URGENT:** Notify team immediately
2. **Check scraper status:** Is it running? Any errors?
3. **Check BigDataBall site:** Is it accessible?
4. **Manual scraper run:** `python scrapers/bigdataball/bigdataball_pbp.py --date $(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)`
5. **Manual processor run:** Process yesterday's files
6. **Verify after fix:** Re-run daily check

---

## üìÖ Weekly Monitoring (Mondays)

### Step 4: Weekly Trend Analysis

**Query:** `weekly_check_last_7_days.sql`  
**Command:** `./scripts/validate-bigdataball weekly`  
**When:** Monday mornings (review past week)

#### What It Shows:
- Daily game coverage for past 7 days
- Event count trends
- Day-of-week patterns
- Coordinate coverage trends

#### Expected Output:

```
| game_date  | day_of_week | scheduled | games_data | avg_events | status      |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 2025-10-27 | Sunday      | 10        | 10         | 465.2      | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2025-10-26 | Saturday    | 10        | 10         | 471.3      | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2025-10-25 | Friday      | 8         | 8          | 458.7      | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2025-10-24 | Thursday    | 6         | 6          | 462.1      | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2025-10-23 | Wednesday   | 8         | 7          | 449.8      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete |
| 2025-10-22 | Tuesday     | 12        | 12         | 473.5      | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2025-10-21 | Monday      | 0         | 0          | 0          | ‚ö™ No games |
```

#### What to Look For:

**‚úÖ Healthy Pattern:**
- Most days: "‚úÖ Complete"
- Event counts: 450-480 range
- Weekend games: Slightly higher attendance (more events)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs:**
- Multiple "‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete" days
- Consistent low event counts (<430)
- Specific day-of-week pattern (e.g., all Wednesdays missing)

**üî¥ Red Flags:**
- Multiple "‚ùå Missing all" days
- Event counts declining over time
- Coordinate coverage dropping

---

## üîî Alert Thresholds & Escalation

### Automated Alerting Setup

```bash
# Add to daily cron job
0 9 * * * cd ~/code/nba-stats-scraper && ./scripts/validate-bigdataball daily | grep -q "‚ùå CRITICAL" && mail -s "BigDataBall CRITICAL Alert" team@example.com
```

### Alert Levels

| Level | Trigger | Notification | Response Time |
|-------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| üü¢ Success | ‚úÖ Complete | Log only | None |
| üü° Info | ‚è≥ Processing | Log only | Check in 2 hours |
| üü† Warning | ‚ö†Ô∏è 1-3 games missing | Slack message | 4 hours |
| üî¥ Critical | ‚ùå No data or >3 missing | Email + Slack + Page | Immediate |

### Escalation Path

**Level 1 (0-2 hours):** Data engineer investigates  
**Level 2 (2-4 hours):** Senior engineer notified  
**Level 3 (4+ hours):** Engineering manager involved  

---

## üìä Monthly Review (First Monday of Month)

### Step 5: Season Completeness Check

**Query:** `season_completeness_check.sql`  
**Command:** `./scripts/validate-bigdataball season`  
**When:** Monthly (first Monday)

#### What to Check:

```bash
# Run full season check
./scripts/validate-bigdataball season > season_monthly.txt

# Key metrics
grep '"reg_games"' season_monthly.txt | head -10
```

**Expected Results:**
- **Early season (Oct-Nov):** 10-15 games per team
- **Mid season (Dec-Feb):** 40-50 games per team
- **Late season (Mar-Apr):** 70-82 games per team

**Warning Signs:**
- Teams with significantly fewer games than others
- Specific teams consistently missing games
- Wide variance in avg_events_per_game across teams

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: BigDataBall 2-Hour Delay

**Symptom:** Yesterday's games show "‚è≥ PROCESSING" at 9 AM.

**Explanation:** BigDataBall releases data ~2 hours after game ends. Late games (10:30 PM ET tip) may not be ready until 2-3 AM.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check again at 11 AM
./scripts/validate-bigdataball daily

# Or use realtime check
./scripts/validate-bigdataball realtime
```

**When to escalate:** If still missing after 12 hours.

---

### Issue 2: Scraper Didn't Run

**Symptom:** All games missing, scraper logs show no recent activity.

**Check:**
```bash
# Check cron schedule
crontab -l | grep bigdataball

# Check scraper logs
tail -50 ~/logs/bigdataball_scraper.log

# Check last run time
ls -lht ~/logs/bigdataball_scraper.log
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manual scraper run for yesterday
python scrapers/bigdataball/bigdataball_pbp.py \
  --date $(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --force
```

---

### Issue 3: Processor Failed

**Symptom:** Files in GCS but not in BigQuery.

**Check:**
```bash
# Files exist in GCS?
gsutil ls gs://nba-scraped-data/big-data-ball/2024-25/$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)/

# Check processor logs
grep "$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)" ~/logs/bigdataball_processor.log | tail -20
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-run processor for specific date
gcloud run jobs execute bigdataball-pbp-processor-backfill \
  --region=us-west2 \
  --args="--start-date,$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d),--end-date,$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

---

### Issue 4: Single Game Missing

**Symptom:** 11 of 12 games present, 1 missing.

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Find which game
./scripts/validate-bigdataball missing | grep $(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)

# Check if file in GCS
gsutil ls gs://nba-scraped-data/big-data-ball/2024-25/$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)/ | grep [GAME_ID]
```

**Common Causes:**
- BigDataBall didn't release that specific game
- File corrupted during scraping
- Processor failed on that specific CSV

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-scrape specific game if available on BigDataBall
# Or wait 24 hours and check if BigDataBall releases it later
```

---

### Issue 5: Low Event Count but Game Complete

**Symptom:** Game has 360-390 events (lower than 400-600 normal).

**Is it a problem?**
- **No if:** Game was a blowout (check final score)
- **No if:** Game ended early due to technical issues
- **Yes if:** Event counts consistently low across multiple games

**Action:**
- If isolated case: Accept and document
- If pattern: Investigate processor logic or BigDataBall quality
