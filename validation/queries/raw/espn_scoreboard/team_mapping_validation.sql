-- File: validation/queries/raw/espn_scoreboard/team_mapping_validation.sql
-- Purpose: Validate ESPN team abbreviation mapping to NBA standard codes
-- Usage: Verify processor team mapping logic and detect unmapped codes
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All mappings: GSâ†’GSW, NYâ†’NYK, SAâ†’SAS, NOâ†’NOP, UTAHâ†’UTA, WSHâ†’WAS
--   - Flag unknown codes: CHK (2), SHQ (1) - investigation needed
--   - EAST (1) = All-Star game - should be filtered by processor
