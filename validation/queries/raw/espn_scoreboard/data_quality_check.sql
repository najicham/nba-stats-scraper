-- File: validation/queries/raw/espn_scoreboard/data_quality_check.sql
-- Purpose: Comprehensive data quality validation for ESPN scoreboard data
-- Usage: Verify score reasonableness, completion status, confidence scores
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - All games should have reasonable scores (60-170 range typical)
--   - is_completed should match game_status = 'final'
--   - processing_confidence should always be 1.0 (ESPN reliable)
--   - No NULL scores for completed games
