-- File: validation/queries/raw/espn_scoreboard/cross_validate_with_nbac.sql
-- Purpose: Cross-validate ESPN scores vs NBA.com Scoreboard V2 (official)
-- Usage: Compare backup source vs official NBA.com game results
-- ============================================================================
-- Expected Results:
--   - Perfect matches expected (both should reflect official scores)
--   - Any mismatch indicates data quality issue needing investigation
--   - ESPN may have fewer games (backup collection pattern)
