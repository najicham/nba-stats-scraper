## 🔍 What Each Validation Checks

### 1. Game Completeness Check
**Query:** Counts rows per game, expects 8
**Logic:** 2 bookmakers × 2 markets × 2 outcomes = 8 rows

```
✅ Bookmaker coverage: 5,236 games have 2 bookmakers (99.54%)
⚠️ Found 24 games with only 1 bookmaker
```

### 3. Market Coverage Check
**Query:** Checks for spreads AND totals per game
**Pass Criteria:** 100% have both markets
**Expected:** All games have both

**Sample Output:**
```
✅ Market coverage: All games have both spreads and totals
```

### 4. Spread Range Validation
**Query:** Finds spreads outside -25 to +25
**Pass Criteria:** 0 spreads outside range
**Expected:** All spreads reasonable

```

### 5. Totals Range Validation

**Pass Criteria:** 0 totals outside range
**Expected:** All totals reasonable (avg ~225)

**Sample Output:**
```

   Average lead time: 1.5 hours before tipoff
```

### 8. Schedule Cross-Validation
**Query:** Matches games with ESPN scoreboard
**Pass Criteria:** Informational only
**Expected:** Some mismatches due to team name differences

**Sample Output:**
```
ℹ️ Schedule cross-validation: 15 games not matched (team name normalization needed)
   Note: ESPN uses "LA Clippers" vs Odds API "Los Angeles Clippers"
```

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Validations

### If Game Completeness Fails:
```sql
-- Find incomplete games
SELECT
  game_date,
  game_id,
  home_team,
  away_team,
  COUNT(*) as row_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT bookmaker_key) as bookmakers,
  COUNT(DISTINCT market_key) as markets
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.odds_api_game_lines`
WHERE game_date >= '2024-01-01'
  AND game_date <= '2024-01-31'
GROUP BY game_date, game_id, home_team, away_team
HAVING row_count != 8
ORDER BY game_date, game_id;
```

### If Spread Range Fails:
```sql
-- Find unusual spreads
SELECT
  game_date,
  home_team,
  away_team,
  bookmaker_key,
  outcome_name,
  outcome_point as spread
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.odds_api_game_lines`
WHERE game_date >= '2024-01-01'
  AND game_date <= '2024-01-31'
  AND market_key = 'spreads'
  AND (outcome_point < -25 OR outcome_point > 25)
ORDER BY ABS(outcome_point) DESC;
```

### If Team Names Fail:
```sql
-- Find invalid team names
SELECT DISTINCT
  home_team,
  COUNT(*) as games
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_raw.odds_api_game_lines`
WHERE game_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY home_team
ORDER BY home_team;
```
