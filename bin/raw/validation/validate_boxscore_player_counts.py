VALIDATOR: NBA Boxscore Player Count Validator (CORRECTED)

File: bin/processors/validation/validate_boxscore_player_counts.py

Validates player count consistency between NBA.com gamebook and BDL boxscore data:
- Compares TOTAL ROSTER SIZE (should match between sources - both include injured)
- Analyzes non-playing player categorization differences
- BDL uses "00" minutes format for DNP+injured, NBA.com separates DNP vs injured
- Identifies games with total roster discrepancies (data quality issues)
- Generates actionable reports for data quality investigation

Usage:
    python validate_boxscore_player_counts.py

Output:
    - Console report with total roster analysis and categorization differences
    - CSV exports with detailed game-by-game comparisons
    - Flagged games requiring data quality investigation
