Model Version Investigation Results
Date: January 18, 2026, 3:30 PM PST
Issue: 62.5% of predictions have NULL model_version
=========================================

## FINDINGS

### 1. NULL Breakdown by System (Jan 17-18, 2026)

Systems WITH model_version populated (37.5%):
✅ catboost_v8 → "v8" (10,636 predictions, 18.75%)
✅ ensemble_v1 → "ensemble_v1" (10,639 predictions, 18.76%)

Systems with NULL model_version (62.5%):
❌ moving_average → NULL (10,775 predictions, 18.99%)
❌ similarity_balanced_v1 → NULL (7,133 predictions, 12.57%)
❌ xgboost_v1 → NULL (6,904 predictions, 12.17%)
❌ zone_matchup_v1 → NULL (10,639 predictions, 18.76%)

### 2. Historical Pattern (Last 7 Days)

NULL percentage over time:
- Jan 18: 66.78% NULL (13,799/20,663)
- Jan 17: 60.08% NULL (22,456/37,379)
- Jan 16: 75.0% NULL (3/4)
- Jan 15: 73.8% NULL (2,383/3,229)
- Jan 14: 73.31% NULL (217/296)
- Jan 13: 74.37% NULL (206/277)
- Jan 12: 58.05% NULL (667/1,149)

Average: ~67% NULL consistently

### 3. Conclusions

Session 101 Status: ❌ NOT EFFECTIVE
- The "model version fix" from Session 101 did NOT resolve the issue
- NULL percentage has been consistent at 60-75% all week
- Only 2 out of 6 systems populate model_version

Root Cause:
- 4 prediction systems don't set model_version in their output
- Systems: moving_average, similarity_balanced_v1, xgboost_v1, zone_matchup_v1
- These systems likely don't have a model_version property or don't pass it to the coordinator

### 4. Recommendations

IMMEDIATE (High Priority):
1. Check prediction coordinator code to see how model_version is populated
2. Verify if these 4 systems HAVE a model version to report
3. Add model_version parameter to these systems' output

MEDIUM TERM:
1. Make model_version a required field (validation in coordinator)
2. Default to system_id if model_version is not provided
3. Add data quality monitoring for NULL model_version

LONG TERM:
1. Standardize all prediction systems to report version info
2. Add versioning to non-ML systems (moving_average, zone_matchup)
3. Track model versions in a separate metadata table

### 5. Session 101 Verification Status

Session 101: ⚠️ UNCLEAR - Need to review what was actually deployed

The verification script expected model_version to be populated, but:
- 62% of predictions still have NULL model_version
- This pattern existed before and after Session 101
- Either the fix was never deployed, or it only applied to 2 systems

Need to check:
- Session 101 handoff documentation
- What code changes were made
- Whether those changes were deployed to production
