File: scrapers/utils/schedule_transformer.py

Shared schedule data enhancement logic for both API and CDN scrapers.
Ensures consistent data format regardless of source.

This module provides:
- Broadcaster analysis and primetime detection
- Game context flags (playoffs, All-Star, etc.)
- Scheduling metadata (time slots, weekends)
- Season progress tracking and metadata generation
