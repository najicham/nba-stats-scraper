NBA Team Name to Abbreviation Mapper

Shared utility for converting Odds API team names to NBA standard abbreviations
and building team-based path suffixes following NBA.com gameCode conventions.

Usage:
    from scrapers.utils.nba_team_mapper import build_teams_suffix, get_team_abbr
    
    # In scraper transform_data():
    teams_suffix = build_teams_suffix("Los Angeles Lakers", "Detroit Pistons")
    # Returns: "LALDET"
    
    # For GCS path building:
    self.opts["teams"] = teams_suffix
