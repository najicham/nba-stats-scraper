## 📈 Data Volume & Frequency

| Workflow | Frequency | Scrapers | Avg Duration | Priority |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Real-Time Business** | Every 2h (8AM-8PM) | 5 scrapers | ~5 minutes | 🔴 Critical |
| **Morning Operations** | Daily 8AM | 7 scrapers | ~10 minutes | 🟡 High |
| **Game Day Evening** | 6PM, 9PM, 11PM | 5 scrapers | ~5 minutes | 🟢 Medium |
| **Post-Game Analysis** | Daily 9PM | 9 scrapers | ~15 minutes | 🔵 Low |

## 🎯 Next Phase: Implementation Status

### **📂 Current File Structure Status**

| Workflow File | Status | Implementation | Scrapers | Schedule |
|---------------|--------|----------------|----------|----------|
| `real-time-business.yaml` | ✅ Exists | 🔄 **UPDATE** | 5 + status | Every 2h (8AM-8PM) |
| `morning-operations.yaml` | ✅ Exists | 🔄 **UPDATE** | 8 + status | Daily 8AM |
| `post-game-collection.yaml` | ✅ Created | ✅ **DEPLOY** | 8 + status | 8PM & 11PM |
| `late-night-recovery.yaml` | ✅ Created | ✅ **DEPLOY** | 7 + status | Daily 2AM |
| `early-morning-final-check.yaml` | ✅ Created | ✅ **DEPLOY** | 7 + status | Daily 6AM |
| `post-game-analysis.yaml` | ❌ Delete | 🗑️ **REMOVE** | Replaced | N/A |

### **🚀 Ready for Deployment**

The foundation is complete! All workflow files are created with:
- ✅ **Status tracking** to GCS implemented
- ✅ **Dependencies** properly handled (Events→Props, ESPN chains)
- ✅ **Recovery strategy** using Option 1 approach
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** and error handling

### **📊 Daily Execution Pattern**
```
Total Daily Executions: 12 workflows
- 6:00 AM → Final Check (1)
- 8:00 AM → Morning Ops (1) + Real-Time #1 (1)
- 10:00 AM - 8:00 PM → Real-Time #2-7 (6)
- 8:00 PM → Post-Game #1 (1)
- 11:00 PM → Post-Game #2 (1)
- 2:00 AM → Recovery (1)
```

### **🎯 Implementation Priority**
1. **Update existing workflows** (maintain revenue stream)
2. **Deploy new workflows** (add recovery capabilities)
3. **Update schedulers** (12 total triggers)
4. **Clean up old files** (remove post-game-analysis)

**System ready for production deployment with comprehensive data collection and recovery capabilities!**
