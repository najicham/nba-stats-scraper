# 03 - Early Exit Conditions Implementation

**Created:** 2025-11-19 11:27 PM PST
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-19 11:27 PM PST
**Pattern:** Early Exit Conditions
**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** High (30-40% savings on off-days)
**Reference:** [Optimization Pattern Catalog](../reference/02-optimization-pattern-catalog.md), Pattern #3

> **📌 STATUS: Can Implement Now (Week 1-2)**
>
> **When to use:** Immediately - saves 30-40% of processing on off-days
>
> **Value:** NBA has ~195 off-days per year (53%!) + full offseason (July-Sept)

---

## Overview

This pattern checks for basic conditions that make processing unnecessary (no games scheduled, offseason, etc.) and exits immediately before any database queries or processing.

### Problem Solved

- ✅ Processor runs on days with no NBA games (off-days)
- ✅ Processor runs during offseason (July-Sept)
- ✅ Wasted compute checking empty data
- ✅ Unnecessary BigQuery quota usage

### How It Works

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Analytics Processor

```python
from data_processors.analytics.analytics_base import AnalyticsProcessorBase
from shared.processors.patterns.early_exit_mixin import EarlyExitMixin

class PlayerGameSummaryProcessor(EarlyExitMixin, AnalyticsProcessorBase):
    """Player stats processor with all early exits enabled."""

    ENABLE_NO_GAMES_CHECK = True
    ENABLE_OFFSEASON_CHECK = True
    ENABLE_HISTORICAL_DATE_CHECK = True

    # ... rest of your processor code ...
```

### Example 2: Custom Configuration

```python
class HistoricalAnalysisProcessor(EarlyExitMixin, AnalyticsProcessorBase):
    """Historical processor - needs old data."""

    ENABLE_NO_GAMES_CHECK = True
    ENABLE_OFFSEASON_CHECK = False  # Process offseason too
    ENABLE_HISTORICAL_DATE_CHECK = False  # Need old data!
```

### Example 3: Regular Season Only

```python
class RegularSeasonProcessor(EarlyExitMixin, AnalyticsProcessorBase):
    """Only process regular season games."""

    ENABLE_NO_GAMES_CHECK = True
    ENABLE_OFFSEASON_CHECK = True

    def _is_offseason(self, game_date: str) -> bool:
        """Custom logic for playoffs too."""
        game_datetime = datetime.strptime(game_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
        month = game_datetime.month

        # Skip offseason (July-Sept) AND playoffs (May-June)
        return month in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Mixin File (10 minutes)

```bash
mkdir -p shared/processors/patterns
touch shared/processors/patterns/__init__.py
```

Copy the mixin code to `shared/processors/patterns/early_exit_mixin.py`

### Step 2: Add to One Processor (5 minutes)

```python
# data_processors/analytics/player_game_summary_processor.py

from shared.processors.patterns.early_exit_mixin import EarlyExitMixin

class PlayerGameSummaryProcessor(EarlyExitMixin, AnalyticsProcessorBase):
    # Enable all checks
    ENABLE_NO_GAMES_CHECK = True
    ENABLE_OFFSEASON_CHECK = True
    ENABLE_HISTORICAL_DATE_CHECK = True

    # ... rest of processor unchanged ...
```

### Step 3: Test Locally (10 minutes)

```python
# Test with off-day
processor = PlayerGameSummaryProcessor()
result = processor.run({'start_date': '2025-11-20', 'end_date': '2025-11-20'})

# Should skip if no games
assert result == True  # Successful skip

# Check logs
# Expected: "No games scheduled on 2025-11-20, skipping"
```

### Step 4: Deploy & Monitor (5 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-processors.yaml

# Monitor skips
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT
    skip_reason,
    COUNT(*) as skip_count
FROM nba_processing.analytics_processor_runs
WHERE DATE(run_date) = CURRENT_DATE()
  AND skip_reason IN ('no_games', 'offseason', 'too_historical')
GROUP BY skip_reason
"
```

## Expected Results

### Typical NBA Season

**Calendar breakdown:**
- Total days per year: 365
- Regular season game days: ~170
- Playoff game days: ~60
- **Off-days: ~195 (53%!)**

**Monthly breakdown:**
- October: 70% game days
- November-April: 80-85% game days
- May-June: 40% game days (playoffs)
- **July-September: 0% game days (offseason)**

### Savings by Check

| Check | Days Saved | % of Year | Example |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **No Games** | ~135 days | 37% | Regular season off-days |
| **Offseason** | ~92 days | 25% | July 1 - Sept 30 |
| **Historical** | Variable | Varies | Depends on backfill needs |
| **Combined** | **~195 days** | **~53%** | Total reduction |

### Real Example

**Week of November 18-24, 2025:**

| Date | Games | Early Exit? | Reason |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Mon 11/18 | 8 games | ❌ Process | Games scheduled |
| Tue 11/19 | 10 games | ❌ Process | Games scheduled |
| Wed 11/20 | 0 games | ✅ Skip | no_games |
| Thu 11/21 | 7 games | ❌ Process | Games scheduled |
| Fri 11/22 | 12 games | ❌ Process | Games scheduled |
| Sat 11/23 | 9 games | ❌ Process | Games scheduled |
| Sun 11/24 | 5 games | ❌ Process | Games scheduled |

**Result:** 1 of 7 days skipped (14% saved in this week)

## Monitoring Queries

### Query: Skip Patterns Over Time

```sql
-- Analyze skip patterns by reason
SELECT
    skip_reason,
    COUNT(*) as skip_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT date_range_start) as unique_dates,
    MIN(date_range_start) as first_skip,
    MAX(date_range_start) as last_skip
FROM nba_processing.analytics_processor_runs
WHERE skip_reason IN ('no_games', 'offseason', 'too_historical')
  AND DATE(run_date) >= CURRENT_DATE() - 30
GROUP BY skip_reason
ORDER BY skip_count DESC;
```

### Query: Off-Day Savings

```sql
-- Calculate time saved from off-day skips
WITH daily_stats AS (
    SELECT
        DATE(run_date) as date,
        COUNTIF(skip_reason = 'no_games') as offday_skips,
        COUNTIF(success AND skip_reason IS NULL) as processing_runs,
        AVG(CASE WHEN success AND skip_reason IS NULL
            THEN duration_seconds ELSE NULL END) as avg_process_duration
    FROM nba_processing.analytics_processor_runs
    WHERE DATE(run_date) >= CURRENT_DATE() - 30
    GROUP BY date
)
SELECT
    SUM(offday_skips) as total_offday_skips,
    ROUND(SUM(offday_skips * avg_process_duration) / 3600, 2) as estimated_hours_saved,
    ROUND(SUM(offday_skips) /
        (SUM(offday_skips) + SUM(processing_runs)) * 100, 1) as skip_percentage
FROM daily_stats;
```

### Query: Seasonal Patterns

```sql
-- Processing patterns by month
SELECT
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_range_start) as month,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_range_start) IN (7,8,9) THEN 'Offseason'
        WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_range_start) IN (10,11,12,1,2,3,4) THEN 'Regular Season'
        WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date_range_start) IN (5,6) THEN 'Playoffs'
    END as season_phase,
    COUNT(*) as total_invocations,
    COUNTIF(success AND skip_reason IS NULL) as processed,
    COUNTIF(skip_reason IN ('no_games', 'offseason')) as skipped,
    ROUND(COUNTIF(skip_reason IN ('no_games', 'offseason')) /
        COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as skip_pct
FROM nba_processing.analytics_processor_runs
WHERE DATE(run_date) >= CURRENT_DATE() - 365
GROUP BY month, season_phase
ORDER BY month;
```

**Expected output:**

| Month | Season | Invocations | Processed | Skipped | Skip % |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Regular | 31 | 25 | 6 | 19.4% |
| 2 | Regular | 28 | 24 | 4 | 14.3% |
| 7 | Offseason | 31 | 0 | 31 | **100%** |
| 8 | Offseason | 31 | 0 | 31 | **100%** |
| 9 | Offseason | 30 | 0 | 30 | **100%** |

## Testing

### Test 1: Off-Day Skip

```python
def test_early_exit_no_games():
    """Test skip when no games scheduled."""
    processor = PlayerGameSummaryProcessor()

    # Run for off-day (verify in game_schedule table first)
    result = processor.run({
        'start_date': '2025-11-20',
        'end_date': '2025-11-20'
    })

    assert result == True  # Successful skip

    # Check logs
    logs = get_processor_logs('2025-11-20')
    assert logs[0]['skip_reason'] == 'no_games'
```

### Test 2: Offseason Skip

```python
def test_early_exit_offseason():
    """Test skip during offseason."""
    processor = PlayerGameSummaryProcessor()

    # August date (offseason)
    result = processor.run({
        'start_date': '2025-08-15',
        'end_date': '2025-08-15'
    })

    assert result == True

    logs = get_processor_logs('2025-08-15')
    assert logs[0]['skip_reason'] == 'offseason'
```

### Test 3: Game Day Processing

```python
def test_early_exit_game_day():
    """Test normal processing on game day."""
    processor = PlayerGameSummaryProcessor()

    # Known game day
    result = processor.run({
        'start_date': '2025-11-18',
        'end_date': '2025-11-18'
    })

    # Should proceed to normal processing
    # (actual result depends on rest of processor logic)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Processor skips game days

**Symptom:** Skip reason shows "no_games" but games were scheduled

**Solution:** Check game_schedule table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM nba_raw.game_schedule WHERE game_date = '2025-11-18';
```

If empty, the issue is with Phase 2 scrapers, not this pattern.

---

### Problem: Offseason check too aggressive

**Symptom:** Skipping preseason games in October

**Solution:** Adjust season months:
```python
def _is_offseason(self, game_date: str) -> bool:
    """Custom offseason logic."""
    game_datetime = datetime.strptime(game_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
    month = game_datetime.month
    day = game_datetime.day

    # Only July, August, early September
    if month in [7, 8]:
        return True
    if month == 9 and day < 15:
        return True

    return False
```

---

### Problem: Want more granular control

**Solution:** Override methods in your processor:
```python
class CustomProcessor(EarlyExitMixin, AnalyticsProcessorBase):

    def _has_games_scheduled(self, game_date: str) -> bool:
        """Custom logic - only check for home team games."""
        query = f"""
        SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt
        FROM nba_raw.game_schedule
        WHERE game_date = '{game_date}'
          AND home_team_id = 'LAL'  # Only Lakers home games
        """
        # ... rest of check
```

---

## Integration with Other Patterns

### With Circuit Breaker (Pattern #5)
Early exit reduces invocations, lowering chance of hitting circuit breaker threshold.

### With Change Detection (Week 1)
Early exit happens BEFORE change detection, saving even the signature query.

### With Dependency Precheck (Pattern #2)
Early exit happens BEFORE dependency checks, saving COUNT(*) queries.

**Order of checks:**
1. **Early Exit** (0.05s) - This pattern
2. Idempotency (0.5s)
3. Change Detection (2s) - Week 1
4. Dependency Check (0.2s) - Pattern #2
5. Processing (30s)

## Configuration Helper

### Analyze Game Schedule Coverage

```python
def analyze_game_schedule(days: int = 365):
    """See what % of days have games."""
    from google.cloud import bigquery

    client = bigquery.Client()

    query = f"""
    WITH date_range AS (
        SELECT date
        FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY(
            DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL {days} DAY),
            CURRENT_DATE()
        )) as date
    ),
    games_by_date AS (
        SELECT
            game_date,
            COUNT(*) as games_count
        FROM nba_raw.game_schedule
        WHERE game_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL {days} DAY)
        GROUP BY game_date
    )
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM dr.date) as month,
        COUNT(*) as total_days,
        COUNTIF(gbd.games_count > 0) as days_with_games,
        COUNTIF(gbd.games_count IS NULL OR gbd.games_count = 0) as days_without_games,
        ROUND(COUNTIF(gbd.games_count > 0) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as pct_days_with_games
    FROM date_range dr
    LEFT JOIN games_by_date gbd ON dr.date = gbd.game_date
    GROUP BY month
    ORDER BY month
    """

    result = client.query(query).to_dataframe()
    print(result)
    return result
```

**Example output:**
```
 month  total_days  days_with_games  days_without_games  pct_days_with_games
     1          31               25                   6                 80.6
     2          28               24                   4                 85.7
     3          31               27                   4                 87.1
     7          31                0                  31                  0.0
     8          31                0                  31                  0.0
     9          30                0                  30                  0.0
```

This shows early exit saves **100% of invocations in summer months!**
