## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "What's working in production today?"
Phases 1-2 are fully operational. We scrape data daily and process it into BigQuery raw tables automatically.

### "When will predictions be live?"
Estimated 3-4 weeks after starting Phase 3 deployment (Sprint 1 → Sprint 6). Phase 5 code is 100% complete.

### "Why isn't Phase 3 deployed yet?"
Missing: Phase 2 → Phase 3 Pub/Sub connection (Sprint 1, ~2 hours to implement).

### "What's the biggest risk?"
XGBoost model training for Phase 5. Currently using mock model. Need real trained model (~4 hours work).

### "Can I use the system for development?"
Yes! All Phase 1-2 data is live. Phase 3-5 code is ready to run locally for testing.
