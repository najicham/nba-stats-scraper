URGENT: CATBOOST V8 SYSTEM FAILURE - USE AGENTS TO INVESTIGATE
================================================================================

**Context**: We discovered the NBA prediction system is broken. CatBoost V8 has had zero premium picks (≥92% confidence) since Jan 8, 2026 due to feature quality degradation.

**Root Cause**: Jan 7 commit (0d7af04c) modified analytics processors, broke feature_quality_score calculation, causing it to drop from 90+ to 80-89, which caps confidence at 89%.

**Your Mission**: Use agents to investigate the Jan 7 commit and feature pipeline, then propose a fix.

================================================================================
REQUIRED AGENT TASKS (Use Task tool with agents!)
================================================================================

Task 1: Review Jan 7 Commit
Agent: general-purpose
Command: git show 0d7af04c0c1e1bf6cfc5a6326cac589ccaa277dd
File: scrapers/nba/analytics/processors/player_aggregations.py (274 lines changed)
Question: What broke feature_quality_score calculation?

Task 2: Trace Feature Quality Pipeline
Agent: Explore (very thorough)
Start: predictions/worker/prediction_systems/catboost_v8.py
Question: How is feature_quality_score calculated end-to-end?

Task 3: Query BigQuery Data
Agent: general-purpose
Table: ml_nba.ml_feature_store_v2
Question: Compare feature quality Dec 20-Jan 7 vs Jan 8-15, what degraded?

Task 4: Find Related Changes
Agent: Explore (medium)
Date Range: Jan 5-10, 2026
Question: What other analytics processor changes happened?

Task 5: Propose Fix
Agent: general-purpose
Based on: Tasks 1-4 findings
Question: Revert commit or targeted fix? Provide diffs.

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM IN 30 SECONDS
================================================================================

BEFORE (Dec 20 - Jan 7): Healthy
- Feature quality: 90+
- Confidence: 60-95% (continuous distribution)
- Premium picks: 10-50 per day
- Win rate: 70%+

AFTER (Jan 8 - Jan 16): Broken
- Feature quality: 80-89
- Confidence: Only 89%, 84%, 50% (three discrete values!)
- Premium picks: ZERO for 8 days
- Win rate at 89% confidence: 41.4% (catastrophic)

ROOT CAUSE: Confidence formula uses feature quality:
- quality >= 90: base 85 + bonus 5 = potential 90-95%
- quality 80-89: base 82 + no bonus = stuck at 89%

When features broke → quality dropped to 80-89 → 91% of picks stuck at 89% → terrible performance

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA (When Fixed)
================================================================================

✅ Premium picks (≥92%) appearing daily
✅ Confidence continuous (not 3 values)
✅ Feature quality ≥90
✅ 89% picks perform >55% win rate
✅ 3+ days of healthy data
