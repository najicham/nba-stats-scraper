## 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: 88-90% Confidence Tier

**The 88-90% tier is CATASTROPHICALLY BAD**: 44.3% win rate

Performance by tier (Dec 20, 2025 - Jan 15, 2026):
- 92%+: 74.8% win rate ✅
- 90-92%: 75.1% win rate ✅  
- **88-90%: 44.3% win rate** ❌❌❌ (7.86 pts avg error)
- 86-88%: 67.6% win rate ✅
- 80-86%: 52.0% win rate ⚠️
- Below 80%: 59.8% win rate ⚠️

**The answer is clear: "DONUT FILTER"**
- Keep: ≥92%, 90-92%, 86-88%

- Result: Remove 252 terrible picks, keep 1,985 good picks
- Volume impact: Only 10.7% reduction

Filter rule:

confidence >= 0.86 AND NOT (confidence >= 0.88 AND confidence < 0.90)
```

## PRIORITY 5: Jan 11-13 Bad Streak

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: ZERO premium picks (≥92% confidence) from Jan 8-15!

| Date | Win Rate | Avg Confidence | Premium Picks |
|------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Jan 1-7 | 66.6% | **90.0%** | Many |
| Jan 8 | 45.8% | 89.0% | **0** ❌ |
| Jan 10 | 50.9% | 84.0% | **0** ❌ |

| Jan 13 | 45.3% | **50.0%** | **0** ❌ |
| Jan 14 | 51.0% | **50.0%** | **0** ❌ |
| Jan 15 | 64.5% | **50.0%** | **0** ❌ |

**Critical finding**: Confidence dropped dramatically on Jan 8
- Jan 1-7: 90% avg confidence
- Jan 8-15: 50-89% avg confidence  
- **Something changed between Jan 7 and Jan 8!**

**Action needed**: Check system logs, deployments, config changes for Jan 7-8.

## PRIORITY 3: Model Consensus

**Limited data** (only Jan 8-15, bad period), but trends:

| Consensus Type | Picks | Win Rate |
|----------------|-------|----------|
| Strong (4+ systems agree) | 179 | 57.5% ✅ |
| Moderate (3 systems) | 27 | 48.1% ⚠️ |
| Split decisions | Various | 40-67% |

**Finding**: Strong consensus (4+ out of 5) performs better
**Caveat**: Small sample size, need 30+ days of data

## IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Deploy "donut filter"** today:
   - Exclude 88-90% confidence tier
   - Keep 86-88%, 90-92%, ≥92%
   - Removes 252 losing picks

2. **Investigate Jan 7-8 incident**:
   - What caused confidence to drop from 90% to 50-73%?
   - System change? Data issue? Config change?

3. **Day-specific strategies**:
   - Increase stakes on Monday/Saturday
   - Monitor Thursday (heavy slates)

4. **Set monthly alert threshold**:
   - Expected baseline: 72-79% win rate per month
   - Alert if below 70%

5. **Wait on consensus filtering**:
   - Need more data (currently only 7 days)
   - Promising but not conclusive

## NEXT QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE

Based on these findings, I recommend investigating:

1. **What changed on Jan 7-8?**
   - Why did confidence drop 40%?
   - Why zero premium picks?

2. **Can we get finer 88-90% breakdown?**
   - Is 88.0-88.9 bad but 89.0-89.9 ok?
   - Or is entire range equally bad?

3. **Player type analysis**:
   - Are specific player types clustering in 88-90% tier?
   - Stars vs role players performance

4. **Line edge analysis**:
   - What's the |predicted - line| distribution by tier?
   - Does 88-90% represent "too close to call" picks?

Let me know if you want me to dig deeper into any of these!
