# Session 80 Handoff - February 2, 2026

## Executive Summary

**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Focus**: Eliminate false alarms + fix grading service outage  
**Result**: ✅ 6 false alarms eliminated, grading service operational, accurate monitoring

**Key Achievement**: Monitoring now tells us WHAT is broken, not just that SOMETHING is broken.

---

## Critical Fixes (4)

### 1. Grading Service - DOWN for 38 Hours ✅

**Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'pubsub_v1'` - Service couldn't boot  
**Cause**: Missing `google-cloud-pubsub==2.18.4` in requirements.txt  
**Fix**: Added dependency, deployed service  
**Impact**: 0 grading for 38 hrs → Service operational, graded 1,282 predictions

### 2. Vegas Coverage - False CRITICAL Alert ✅

**Problem**: 44.2% showing 🔴 CRITICAL (threshold: 90%)  
**Reality**: 44.2% is NORMAL - sportsbooks only offer props for 40-50% of players  
**Fix**: Threshold 90% → 35% (based on 7-day historical analysis)  
**Impact**: ✅ HEALTHY at 44.2% (accurate)

### 3. Grading Completeness - 5 False Alerts ✅

**Problem**: 5 models showing CRITICAL when grading was actually 88% complete  
**Cause**: Counted ungradable predictions (NO_PROP_LINE) in coverage calculation  
**Fix**: Split into 3 metrics:
- **Grading Coverage**: graded / gradable (ACTUAL_PROP + ESTIMATED_AVG only)
- **Line Availability**: % with real betting lines (informational)
- **Ungradable Count**: NO_PROP_LINE visibility

**Impact**:
| Model | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| catboost_v8 | 44.3% CRITICAL | 88.2% OK ✅ |
| zone_matchup_v1 | 44.3% CRITICAL | 88.2% OK ✅ |
| ensemble_v1 | 44.3% CRITICAL | 88.2% OK ✅ |

### 4. Prediction Deactivation Bug - Recurrence ✅

**Problem**: 1,179 predictions marked inactive (Session 78 bug on old data)  
**Fix**: Ran data repair query to re-activate  
**Impact**: Grading coverage 14.9% → 48.0% (3.2x improvement)

---

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Dependency**: requirements.txt incomplete, failed in Docker (worked locally)
2. **Unrealistic Thresholds**: No historical analysis before setting 90% Vegas threshold  
3. **Wrong Denominator**: Grading metric included ungradable predictions
4. **Historical Data**: Bug fix didn't repair old data

## Commits (3)

1. **e29bf658**: Vegas thresholds + grading service fix + monitoring files
2. **f896c15e**: Integration test threshold updates  
3. **5cf4f0da**: Multi-metric grading monitoring

## Current Status

### Health Check Results
```
Vegas Coverage:        ✅ HEALTHY (44.2%, threshold 35%)
Grading Coverage:      🔴 1 CRITICAL, 🟡 1 WARNING, ✅ 7 OK
Line Availability:     ⚠️ 8 LOW (informational - expected)
Phase 3:               ✅ PASS
BDB Coverage:          ✅ PASS (100%)
```

### Outstanding Issues

**CRITICAL (1)**:
- catboost_v9_2026_02: New Feb model, needs first grading run (will auto-resolve)

**WARNING (1)**:
- catboost_v9: 52.3% coverage (Feb 2 games in progress, will improve)

**Informational**:
- Line availability 36-40% (expected - not all players get props)

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Validate Thresholds with Data
❌ Don't: Set 90% threshold based on assumption  
✅ Do: Analyze 1-2 weeks historical data, set at p5/p1

### 2. One Metric = One Thing
❌ Don't: Mix grading health + line availability in one metric  
✅ Do: Separate metrics for each system component

### 3. False Alarms Destroy Trust
**Impact**: 5 false CRITICAL alerts → team ignores real alerts  
**Goal**: 95%+ alert precision

### 4. Test Docker Builds
**Lesson**: Missing dependencies fail in Docker, not local dev  
**Practice**: `docker run <image> python -c "import service"` before deploy

### 5. Monitor the Right Denominator
❌ Wrong: `graded / all_predictions` = 44%  
✅ Right: `graded / gradable_predictions` = 88%

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Health check
./bin/monitoring/unified-health-check.sh --verbose

# Grading backfill
PYTHONPATH=. python backfill_jobs/grading/prediction_accuracy/prediction_accuracy_grading_backfill.py \
  --start-date 2026-02-02 --end-date 2026-02-02

# Deploy service
./bin/deploy-service.sh nba-grading-service
```

---

## Next Session

### Check First
- [ ] Verify catboost_v9_2026_02 graded (auto-resolves)
- [ ] Health check: `./bin/monitoring/unified-health-check.sh --verbose`
- [ ] No new false alarms

### Consider
1. Automate new model grading detection?
2. Add grading latency metrics?
3. Alert if line availability drops <30%?
