I'm continuing work on the NBA prediction system after Session 115 completed major fixes and deployments.

## Session 115 Summary (COMPLETE ✅)

Session 115 successfully:
1. ✅ Deployed DNP bug fixes (99.7% data quality)
2. ✅ Discovered and fixed critical Phase 3 schema bug (7 column mismatches)
3. ✅ Regenerated Phase 3 data for Feb 1-4 (1,035 records, 97% success)
4. ✅ Improved Phase 3/4 consistency from 50% → 82-85%
5. ✅ All changes committed and deployed

**Key Findings:**
- DNP caching (70-160/day) is INTENTIONAL design (not a bug)
- Schema bug was blocking all Phase 3 regeneration - now fixed
- Both Phase 3 and Phase 4 have correct DNP filtering code
- ML predictions using Phase 4 data are accurate (99.7%)

**Deployed Services:**
- nba-phase3-analytics-processors @ commit 33af5764 (schema fix)
- nba-phase4-precompute-processors @ commit 61ea8dac (DNP fix)

## Current Status

**Production:** ✅ HEALTHY
- Data quality: 99.7% (Feb 2026), 99.4% (Jan 2026), 97.2% (Dec 2025)
- All critical issues resolved
- Schema fix deployed and validated

**Data Quality:**
- ML Feature Store: 71.7% High quality (85+)
- ML Feature vs Cache match: 99.7%
- Phase 3/4 consistency: 82-85% (improved from 50%)
- Team pace: Normal range (no outliers)

## Your Mission

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Monitor Feb 5 Data Generation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Wait for games on Feb 5
   - Verify Phase 3 uses deployed schema fix
   - Check for any 400 schema errors in logs
   - Validate Phase 3/4 consistency for new dates

2. **Run System Validation** (QUICK CHECK)
   ```bash
   /spot-check-features  # or /validate-daily
   ```

3. **Optional: Regenerate November 2025**
   - Current match rate: 67.6% (vs 99%+ for recent months)
   - Target: 95%+
   - Training data quality improvement only
   - Not blocking production

4. **Optional: Run Model Experiment**
   - Current data quality is excellent (99.7%)
   - Measure impact of clean data on predictions
   - `/model-experiment`

## Important Context

**Session 115 Key Insights:**
- Schema drift is silent (column names changed, Phase 3 not updated)
- DNP caching architecture is intentional (filtering at calc time, not write time)
- Opus investigation prevented false bug reports
- 97% regeneration success rate is excellent

**Files to Reference:**
- Main handoff: `docs/09-handoff/2026-02-04-NEXT-SESSION-START-HERE.md`
- Complete details: `docs/09-handoff/2026-02-04-SESSION-115-FINAL-HANDOFF.md`
- Schema bug: `docs/08-projects/current/2026-02-04-session-115-phase3-schema-bug/SCHEMA-MISMATCH-BUG.md`

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
./bin/whats-deployed.sh

# Verify Phase 3/4 consistency
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT p3.game_date, COUNT(*) as total,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNTIF(ABS(p3.points_avg_last_5 - p4.points_avg_last_5) < 0.1) / COUNT(*), 1) as match_pct
FROM nba_analytics.upcoming_player_game_context p3
JOIN nba_precompute.player_daily_cache p4
  ON p3.player_lookup = p4.player_lookup AND p3.game_date = p4.cache_date
WHERE p3.game_date >= CURRENT_DATE() - 3
GROUP BY p3.game_date ORDER BY p3.game_date DESC
"

# Check recent predictions
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT game_date, COUNT(*) as predictions
FROM nba_predictions.player_prop_predictions
WHERE game_date >= CURRENT_DATE() - 3
GROUP BY game_date ORDER BY game_date DESC
"
```

## Decision Points

**If Feb 5 data looks good:**
- ✅ Schema fix working in production
- Consider November regeneration (optional)
- Run model experiment (optional)

**If Phase 3/4 consistency drops:**
- Check if Phase 3 needs regeneration for new dates
- Verify DNP filtering still working (check #23 in spot-check-features)

**If you see schema errors:**
- Should be fixed (check deployment: 33af5764)
- Review logs for specific error
- May need additional column fixes

## Bottom Line

Session 115 fixed all critical issues. Production is healthy (99.7% quality). Next step is to monitor Feb 5 to confirm schema fix works in live pipeline. All documentation ready at `docs/09-handoff/2026-02-04-NEXT-SESSION-START-HERE.md`.

**Ready to continue!** 🚀
