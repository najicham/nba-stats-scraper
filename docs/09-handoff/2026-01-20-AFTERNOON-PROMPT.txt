URGENT: Props scraping failed at 10:00 AM. Deploying fix now (10:13 AM PST).

SITUATION:
- Time: 10:13 AM PST (1:13 PM ET)
- Props scraping triggered at 10:00 AM but FAILED (3 scrapers, 0 succeeded)
- Root cause: Incomplete dotenv fix - missed scrapers/scraper_flask_mixin.py
- Fix: Made all dotenv imports optional (commit 9cab85e7)
- Deployment: In progress (task b6f7a19)
- ETA: ~5-10 minutes

WHAT WENT WRONG:
- Earlier today we fixed dotenv in __init__.py and main_scraper_service.py
- But scraper_flask_mixin.py (base class for ALL scrapers) also imports dotenv
- When scrapers tried to run at 10:00 AM, they crashed with ModuleNotFoundError

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Wait for deployment to complete (~5 min)
2. Test Phase 1 health endpoint
3. Manually retrigger betting_lines workflow OR trigger individual scrapers
4. Monitor props data appearing in BigQuery
5. Phase 3 (Quick Win #1) needs to run at 11:00 AM - we have 45 minutes

CRITICAL TIMING:
- 10:00-10:15 AM: Props scraping window (MISSED - need manual trigger)
- 11:00 AM: Phase 3 Analytics (Quick Win #1 validation!)
- We can recover if we trigger scrapers in next 30 minutes

GIT STATUS:
- Branch: week-0-security-fixes
- Latest commit: 9cab85e7 (complete Phase 1 dotenv fix)
- Deployment: Phase 1 Scrapers (revision 00106 expected)

ALL SERVICES STATUS:
