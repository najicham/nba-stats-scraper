I'm continuing Phase 1 implementation from Session 112 (January 18, 2026).

## Context:
Session 112 completed ALL Phase 1 code implementation:
- ✅ 12 new infrastructure modules created (canary script, retry jitter, connection pools, validation integration, etc.)
- ✅ All code tested with 47 passing unit tests
- ✅ Complete documentation (8 files)
- ⏳ Zero deployments done yet (intentional - needs testing)

All infrastructure is coded and ready. Now we need to deploy and integrate.

## Please read this handoff document first:
/home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/09-handoff/SESSION-112-PHASE1-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md

This contains:
- Complete status of what's done
- Exact commands to run for deployment
- Integration guide for retry jitter and connection pools
- Service URLs and GCP configuration
- Troubleshooting guide

## Goals for THIS session:

### Primary Goal: Deploy to Staging (4-6 hours)
1. Deploy prediction-coordinator to staging using the new canary script
2. Test /health and /ready endpoints work correctly
3. Deploy remaining 5 services to staging
4. Run smoke tests and verify all pass
5. Monitor staging logs for any issues

### Secondary Goal (if time): Begin Code Integration (4-6 hours)
6. Start integrating retry jitter into existing retry logic
7. Start integrating connection pools into BigQuery/HTTP code
8. Test integrated changes in staging

## Start with:

```bash
cd /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper

# Deploy first service to staging
./bin/deploy/canary_deploy.sh prediction-coordinator predictions/coordinator

# Test health endpoints
curl https://STAGING-URL/health | jq
curl https://STAGING-URL/ready | jq

# Run smoke tests
export ENVIRONMENT=staging
pytest tests/smoke/test_health_endpoints.py -v
```

## Important notes:
- All code was implemented in Session 112 but NOT deployed yet
- Services currently in production have OLD basic health endpoints
- Our NEW health endpoints add /ready with deep dependency checks
- Canary script is ready to use but untested in real deployment
- We have ~20-30 hours of work remaining (deployment + integration)

Ready to deploy to staging and test! Let me know when you want to start.
