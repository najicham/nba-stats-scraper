Hi! Please read this handoff document from the previous session and then let's continue:

/home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/09-handoff/2026-01-21-ROBUSTNESS-COMPLETE-HANDOFF.md

After reading, here's what I'd like to do:

1. First, validate today's (January 21, 2026) daily orchestration - check if the pipeline ran successfully and all data is present

2. Then, let's look for new areas to improve. Please:
   - Run the analysis queries from the handoff doc (pipeline performance, data quality, prediction accuracy, etc.)
   - Identify the top 3-5 issues or opportunities for improvement
   - Prioritize them by impact and effort
   - Recommend which one we should tackle first

3. If everything looks good with daily ops and we have time, let's either:
   - Deploy the robustness improvements to staging (they're 100% complete and tested)
   OR
   - Start working on the highest-priority improvement you identified

Please be thorough but efficient. Use your judgment on what makes the most sense based on what you find in the validation queries.
