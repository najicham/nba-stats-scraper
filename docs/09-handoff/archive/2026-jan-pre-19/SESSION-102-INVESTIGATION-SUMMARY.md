# Session 102 - Performance Investigation & Coordinator Fix

**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Focus:** Coordinator timeout investigation and batch loading deployment

---

## 🎯 Investigation Summary

### **Comprehensive Codebase Analysis** (4 parallel agents)

1. **CatBoost V8 Tests** - ✅ **Already Complete!**
   - Found 32 comprehensive tests (handoff doc was outdated)
   - Excellent coverage: model loading, features, validation, error handling
   - **No action needed** - priority #1 from handoff doesn't exist

2. **Coordinator Performance** - 🔴 **Critical Issue Found**
   - Batch loading bypassed since Session 78
   - Workers querying individually: **~225s** (vs <3s with batch)
   - Root cause: 30s timeout too aggressive for 300-360 players
   - Fix already committed but **not deployed**

3. **Stubbed Analytics Features** - ✅ **13 Features Ready**
   - Travel context (5 fields) - data ready ✅
   - Team pace metrics (3 fields) - data ready ✅
   - Forward schedule (4 fields) - data ready ✅
   - Blocked: Player age (needs birth_date fix)

4. **Monitoring & Alerts** - 🟡 **Infrastructure Exists**
   - Grading coverage alert template ready
   - AlertManager duplicated in 3 locations
   - Needs activation and consolidation

## ✅ Deployment Completed

### **Coordinator Batch Loading Fix**

**Deployed:** 2026-01-18 17:42 UTC
**Revision:** prediction-coordinator-00049-zzk
**Status:** Healthy ✅

**Changes:**
- ✅ Re-enabled batch historical loading (was bypassed)
- ✅ Increased timeout: 30s → 120s (4x buffer)
- ✅ Added performance metrics logging

**Expected Impact:**
- 🚀 **75-110x speedup**: 225s → 2-3s for 360 players
- 💰 **99% cost reduction**: 1 query vs 360 individual queries
- ⚡ **Lower worker latency**: Pre-loaded data

**Verification:**
- Next run: 23:00 UTC (same-day-predictions-tomorrow)
- Monitor batch_load_time metric
- Confirm <10s for production loads

## 📊 Key Findings

### **What the Handoff Got Wrong:**
1. ❌ CatBoost V8 has ZERO tests → **Actually has 32 tests**
2. ❌ Coordinator performance "uninvestigated" → **Session 78 timeout known issue**
3. ❌ All stubbed features need implementation → **13 ready with existing data**

### **What We Discovered:**
1. ✅ **Production running OLD code** - batch loading bypassed
2. ✅ **Fix exists but not deployed** - commit 546e5283 from Jan 18 09:16
3. ✅ **Performance bottleneck identified** - 75-110x slower than possible
4. ✅ **Clear deployment path** - tested and deployed successfully

## 🎯 Real Priorities (Updated)

### **CRITICAL (Completed)**
1. ✅ Deploy coordinator batch loading fix
2. ⏳ Monitor first 3 production runs (in progress)

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Ready to start)**
1. **Implement stubbed features** (2-4 hours each):
   - Team pace metrics (EASY - 2-3 hours)
   - Travel context (MEDIUM - 5-8 hours)
   - Forward schedule (EASY - 3-4 hours)

2. **Fix grading coverage alert** (30 mins):
   - Template exists, needs activation
   - Add coverage query to nba-grading-alerts service

3. **Consolidate AlertManager** (2 hours):
   - Remove 2 duplicate copies
   - Update imports

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
1. Monitor backfill completion (passive)
2. Document placeholder remediation completion
3. Choose next strategic project

## 📈 Performance Investigation Details

### **Coordinator Configuration (Production)**
- Timeout: 600s (10 min) ✅
- Memory: 4Gi ✅
- CPU: 2 cores ✅
- **No Cloud Run timeout issue**

### **Identified Bottlenecks**
1. **Batch loading bypassed** (FIXED) ✅
   - Impact: 75-110x performance loss
   - Status: Deployed and awaiting verification

2. **N+1 betting line queries** (Not addressed):
   - 450 individual queries for betting lines
   - Opportunity: Batch optimization similar to historical games
   - Estimated impact: 27s → 1-2s

3. **Session 78 timeout** (Root cause found):
   - Not a Cloud Run timeout (600s is sufficient)
   - Was BigQuery timeout (30s too aggressive)
   - Fixed with 120s timeout

## 📝 Monitoring Plan

### **Next 6 Hours**
- ⏳ Wait for 23:00 UTC coordinator run
- 📊 Capture first batch loading metrics
- ✅ Verify no timeout errors

### **Monitoring Commands**

**1. Check batch loading success:**
```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.labels.service_name="prediction-coordinator" AND 
   jsonPayload.message:"Batch loaded" AND 
   timestamp>="2026-01-18T23:00:00Z"' \
  --limit=5
```

**2. Check performance metrics:**
```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.labels.service_name="prediction-coordinator" AND 
   jsonPayload.batch_load_time!=null' \
  --limit=10 --format=json | \
  jq -r '.[] | [.timestamp, .jsonPayload.batch_load_time, .jsonPayload.player_count] | @tsv'
```

**3. Check for errors:**
```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.labels.service_name="prediction-coordinator" AND 
   severity>=ERROR AND 
   timestamp>="2026-01-18T23:00:00Z"' \
  --limit=20
```

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ Batch load completes in <10s
- ✅ No timeout errors for 3 consecutive days
- ✅ Workers using pre-loaded data
- ✅ 75-110x speedup confirmed
