HISTORICAL DATA AUDIT - QUICK START PROMPT
================================================================================

I need you to audit all historical NBA prediction data to verify data quality
and identify placeholder line issues across all systems and time periods.

BACKGROUND:
- Recently discovered: CatBoost V8 used placeholder lines (20.0) instead of 
  real DraftKings lines from Nov 4 - Dec 19, 2025
- XGBoost V1 used placeholders on Jan 9-10, 2026
- Historical data shows 72-79% win rates but unknown if using real lines

MISSION:
Analyze `nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.prediction_accuracy` table to:
1. Inventory all systems and their date ranges
2. Identify placeholder lines (line_value = 20.0) by system and date
3. Determine when each system transitioned to real lines
4. Assess data quality and trustworthiness
5. Identify gaps and missing data
6. Provide backfill requirements

KEY DETECTION:
- Placeholder (INVALID): line_value = 20.0
- Real line (VALID): line_value != 20.0

SYSTEMS TO CHECK:
- catboost_v8
- xgboost_v1
- moving_average
- moving_average_baseline_v1
- ensemble_v1
- zone_matchup_v1
- similarity_balanced_v1
- Any others found

DELIVERABLES NEEDED:
1. System Status Table (system, date range, real line %, status)
2. Monthly Quality Matrix (which months have clean data)
3. Problem Periods List (date ranges with placeholders)
4. Data Trust Assessment (what can be used for analysis)
5. Backfill Requirements (what needs to be fixed)

TASKS TO COMPLETE:
1. System Inventory (what systems exist, date ranges, volumes)
2. Placeholder Detection (find all placeholder usage by system/date)
3. System Timeline (when did each switch from placeholder to real lines)
4. Performance Comparison (real lines vs placeholders)
5. Monthly Quality Report (data quality by month)
6. Gap Analysis (missing dates)
7. Line Distribution (validate line values are realistic)
8. Cross-System Validation (consistency checks)

EXPECTED TIMELINE: 30-60 minutes

FULL CONTEXT: See docs/09-handoff/HISTORICAL_DATA_AUDIT_PROMPT.md

Please start with Task 1 (System Inventory) and work systematically through
all 8 tasks, then provide comprehensive deliverables.
