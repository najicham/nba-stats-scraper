Context from Recent Sessions:
- NBA platform operational (Session 82 complete)
- MLB prediction system functional but has optimization opportunities
- Batch predictions can be 30-40% faster with improvements
- Feature coverage needs better monitoring
- See: docs/09-handoff/OPTION-A-MLB-OPTIMIZATION-HANDOFF.md

Starting Option A: MLB Performance Optimization
===============================================

Goal: Optimize MLB prediction system for 30-40% faster batch predictions
and add feature coverage monitoring.

Business Value:
- Faster prediction generation (30-40% improvement)
- Better resource utilization (lower costs)
- Feature coverage visibility
- Quick wins with low risk

What to Build:
1. Batch Prediction Optimization
   - Parallel processing improvements
   - Query optimization in feature fetching
   - Caching strategy for repeated lookups
   - Reduce redundant BigQuery calls

2. Feature Coverage Monitoring
   - Track which features are missing for predictions
   - Alert on low feature availability
   - Dashboard for feature completeness

3. Performance Metrics
   - Prediction latency tracking
   - Throughput measurements
   - Resource utilization monitoring

Expected Time: 4-6 hours
- Analysis: 1-2 hours
- Implementation: 2-3 hours
- Testing & validation: 1 hour

Deliverables:
- [ ] Optimized batch prediction code (30-40% faster)
- [ ] Feature coverage monitoring dashboard/alerts
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (before/after)
- [ ] Documentation of optimization techniques
- [ ] Create OPTION-A-MLB-OPTIMIZATION-COMPLETE.md handoff

Current MLB System State:
- Prediction system: Functional
- Batch processing: Works but can be faster
- Feature pipeline: Stable
- Opportunity: Parallel processing, caching, query optimization

Optimization Areas:
1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Current: Sequential prediction generation
   - Target: Batch parallel processing (10-20 predictions at once)

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Current: Individual feature fetches per prediction
   - Target: Bulk feature fetching, shared queries

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Current: No caching
   - Target: Cache player stats, team data for batch duration

4. **Feature Monitoring**
   - Current: No visibility into missing features
   - Target: Dashboard + alerts for feature gaps

Success Metrics:
- 30-40% reduction in batch prediction time
- < 5% feature coverage gaps for active players
- No accuracy degradation
- Cost neutral or reduced (better resource usage)

Risk Level: LOW
- Changes are performance-focused, not algorithmic
- Can be tested thoroughly before deployment
- Easy rollback if issues arise
- MLB system is separate from NBA (no cross-impact)

Recommended Approach:
1. Profile current performance (establish baseline)
2. Implement parallel processing first (biggest win)
3. Add query optimization
4. Implement caching
5. Add feature monitoring
6. Benchmark and compare to baseline
7. Deploy with gradual rollout

This is a quick win project - tangible performance improvements in 4-6 hours of work.

Start by reading the full implementation guide in OPTION-A-MLB-OPTIMIZATION-HANDOFF.md.

Note: This is independent of NBA work and can be done anytime. Good for when you want a focused optimization task with clear, measurable results.
