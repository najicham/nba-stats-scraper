Starting Session 83: Week 2 Warning-Level Alerts
=================================================

Goal: Implement 3-4 warning-level alerts to catch issues before they become critical

What to Build:
1. Stale Predictions Alert (WARNING) - No predictions for 2+ hours
2. DLQ Depth Alert (WARNING) - Messages accumulating in dead letter queue
3. Feature Pipeline Staleness (WARNING) - ml_feature_store_v2 not updating
4. Confidence Distribution Drift (WARNING) - Unusual confidence score patterns

Expected Time: 2-3 hours

Deliverables:
- [ ] 3-4 warning-level alerts in Cloud Monitoring
- [ ] Runbook sections for each alert in ALERT-RUNBOOKS.md
- [ ] Test that alerts can trigger
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md to mark Week 2 complete
- [ ] Create SESSION-83-WEEK2-ALERTS-COMPLETE.md handoff
