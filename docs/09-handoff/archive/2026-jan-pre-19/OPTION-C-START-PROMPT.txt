Context from Session 82 (2026-01-17):
- NBA platform operational and healthy
- Data pipeline (Phases 1-4) working correctly
- Current backfill status: Partial historical data exists
- Need: Complete historical dataset for ML model training
- See: docs/09-handoff/SESSION-82-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md

Starting Option C: Backfill Pipeline Advancement
================================================

Goal: Complete historical backfill from Nov 2021 → Present (~1,121 dates)
This is required for training production ML models and backtesting strategies.

Business Value:
- Enable real ML model training (not mocks)
- Support backtesting and strategy validation
- Build complete historical dataset
- Foundation for Option D (Phase 5 Deployment)

What to Build:
1. Automated backfill orchestration
   - Date range: 2021-11-01 → 2026-01-17 (~1,121 dates)
   - All phases: Raw → Analytics → Precompute → Predictions

2. Progress tracking & monitoring
   - BigQuery table to track completion by date/phase
   - Dashboards to visualize progress
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. Quality validation
   - Data completeness checks
   - Quality tier verification
   - Missing game detection

Expected Time: 15-25 hours (mostly automated running time)
- Setup: 3-4 hours
- Monitoring: 2-3 hours over several days
- The rest is automated execution

Deliverables:
- [ ] Backfill orchestration script/workflow
- [ ] Progress tracking table in BigQuery
- [ ] Quality validation checks
- [ ] ~1,121 dates of historical data backfilled
- [ ] Completion report with coverage metrics
- [ ] Create OPTION-C-BACKFILL-COMPLETE.md handoff

Implementation Guide: docs/09-handoff/OPTION-C-BACKFILL-ADVANCEMENT-HANDOFF.md

Current State:
- Project: nba-props-platform
- Recent dates: Working (2026-01-16, 2026-01-17)
- Historical gaps: Need to fill Nov 2021 → early 2026
- Data sources available: BDL, NBA.com (historical access needed)

Key Considerations:
1. Rate limiting: Don't overwhelm APIs
2. Cost management: Monitor BigQuery/Cloud Run costs
3. Incremental approach: Backfill in batches (e.g., month at a time)
4. Resume capability: Track progress, handle failures gracefully
5. Data quality: Some historical data may be lower quality

Recommended Approach:
1. Start with recent history (last 3 months) to validate
2. Work backwards in time
3. Run in batches overnight/weekends
4. Monitor for issues, adjust as needed
5. Prioritize dates with more games (avoid off-season gaps)

Success Metrics:
- 95%+ date coverage (some dates may have no games)
- Gold/Silver tier data quality for 80%+ of records
- All 4 phases complete for each date
- No critical data integrity issues

This is a "set it and forget it" task - you'll set up the automation, let it run for several days, and monitor progress. Most of the 15-25 hours is waiting time, not active work.

Start by reading the full implementation guide in OPTION-C-BACKFILL-ADVANCEMENT-HANDOFF.md.

Note: This is a prerequisite for Option D (Phase 5 Deployment). Once backfill is substantially complete (80%+), you can start Option D in parallel.
