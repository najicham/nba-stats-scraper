Context from Session 82 (2026-01-17):
- Week 1 critical alerts deployed and healthy
  • [CRITICAL] NBA Model Loading Failures
  • [CRITICAL] NBA High Fallback Prediction Rate
- Alert runbooks created with Week 1 sections
- Recent incident: 3-day CatBoost failure went undetected
- Need: Comprehensive monitoring to prevent similar incidents
- See: docs/09-handoff/SESSION-82-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md

Starting Option B: NBA Alerting & Monitoring (Weeks 2-4)
========================================================

Goal: Build comprehensive alerting and monitoring infrastructure to prevent
incidents like the 3-day CatBoost model loading failure.

Business Value:
- Prevent silent failures (early detection)
- Comprehensive visibility into platform health
- Proactive issue detection vs reactive firefighting
- Reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)

What to Build:

Week 2: Warning-Level Alerts (8-10 hours)
- [ ] Stale Predictions Alert
- [ ] DLQ Depth Alert
- [ ] Feature Pipeline Staleness
- [ ] Confidence Distribution Drift
- [ ] Environment Variable Monitoring (NEW - catches CatBoost-style issues)
- [ ] Data Source Health Checks
- [ ] Prediction Latency Alerts

Week 3: Infrastructure Monitoring (10-12 hours)
- [ ] Cloud Monitoring Dashboards
  • Prediction metrics dashboard
  • Data pipeline health dashboard
  • Model performance dashboard
- [ ] Environment Variable Tracking System
  • Log all env var changes
  • Alert on unexpected changes
  • Audit trail for deployments
- [ ] Resource Utilization Alerts
  • Memory/CPU warnings
  • Cost spike detection

Week 4: Operational Excellence (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Daily Slack Summary
  • Automated digest of platform health
  • Key metrics and trends
  • Action items if needed
- [ ] Weekly Health Reports
  • Prediction accuracy trends
  • Data quality metrics
  • Infrastructure health
- [ ] Alert Fatigue Prevention
  • Tune thresholds based on real data
  • Composite alerts (multiple conditions)
  • Smart grouping and suppression

Expected Time: 24-30 hours total
- Week 2: 8-10 hours
- Week 3: 10-12 hours
- Week 4: 6-8 hours

Deliverables:
- [ ] 10-15 alerts across CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO levels
- [ ] 3+ Cloud Monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Environment variable monitoring system
- [ ] Daily Slack summary automation
- [ ] Complete runbook documentation
- [ ] Alert response playbooks
- [ ] Create OPTION-B-NBA-ALERTING-COMPLETE.md handoff

Implementation Guide: docs/09-handoff/OPTION-B-NBA-ALERTING-HANDOFF.md

Current System State:
- Project: nba-props-platform
- Week 1 alerts: ✅ Deployed (Model Loading, Fallback Rate)
- Gaps: No env var monitoring, no dashboards, no daily summaries
- Recent lesson: CatBoost CATBOOST_V8_MODEL_PATH deleted, undetected for 3 days

Key Lessons from CatBoost Incident:
1. **Environment variables need monitoring** - Would have caught CATBOOST_V8_MODEL_PATH deletion
2. **Startup validation helps but isn't enough** - Need ongoing monitoring
3. **Silent failures are dangerous** - Predictions were degraded but no alerts
4. **Daily summaries would help** - Would have noticed 50% confidence anomaly

Alert Philosophy (from incident):
- **CRITICAL**: System broken, immediate action needed
- **WARNING**: Degraded but functional, investigate soon (2-4 hours)
- **INFO**: Trends and awareness, review daily

This is NOT Session 83/84 (quick wins):
- Session 83: 4 alerts in 2-3 hours (basic coverage)
- Option B: 10-15 alerts + infrastructure in 26 hours (comprehensive)

Choose Option B if:
- You want to do alerting RIGHT, not just quick
- You have 26 hours to invest over 2-3 weeks
- You want to prevent the next CatBoost-style incident
- You value comprehensive visibility

Recommended Approach:
1. **Week 2 First** (8-10 hours):
   - Build core warning alerts
   - Add environment variable monitoring
   - This gives you the most important coverage

2. **Week 3 Second** (10-12 hours):
   - Build dashboards for visibility
   - Implement env var tracking system
   - Makes debugging much easier

3. **Week 4 Last** (6-8 hours):
   - Automate daily summaries
   - Fine-tune alerts
   - Polish the system

Can be done in 3 weekend sessions or spread over 2-3 weeks of evenings.

Start by reading the full implementation guide in OPTION-B-NBA-ALERTING-HANDOFF.md.

Note: This is the comprehensive version. If you already started Session 83 (quick alerts), you can either:
- Complete Session 83 as a quick win, then do Option B later to expand it
- Abandon Session 83 and do Option B from scratch for comprehensive coverage

I recommend completing Session 83 first if you already started it, then doing Option B as "Session 83 Extended" to build out full infrastructure.
