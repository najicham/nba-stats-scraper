Then:

1. Test the skill by running: /validate-daily

2. Provide feedback on:
   - Is the skill effective? Does it provide value over manual validation?
   - Is the investigation depth sufficient for novel issues?
   - Is the output format clear and actionable?
   - Are there validation aspects missing?
   - Is the documentation quality sufficient for future maintenance?
   - Is the P1-P5 severity classification appropriate?
   - Which future enhancements should be prioritized?

3. Note any issues or improvements needed

The skill was tested manually (before discovery) and successfully detected 3 P1 critical issues with proper root cause analysis. This is the first real test of the `/validate-daily` command invocation.
