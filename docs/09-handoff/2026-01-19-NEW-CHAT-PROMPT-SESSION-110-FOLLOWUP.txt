I'm continuing work from Session 110 (January 18, 2026).

## Context:
Session 110 successfully deployed Ensemble V1.1 with performance-based weights:
- ✅ Ensemble V1.1 implemented and deployed (prediction-worker-00072-cz2)
- ✅ Model version NULL fix (62.5% of predictions)
- ✅ CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Session 107 metrics were never deployed to production
- ✅ All code committed (6 commits)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created

## CRITICAL FINDING:
Session 107 documentation says "✅ COMPLETE" but BigQuery verification shows **6+ metrics were NEVER deployed**:
- 5 variance metrics (opponent_ft_rate_variance, opponent_def_rating_variance, etc.)
- 2 enhanced star tracking (questionable_star_teammates, star_tier_out)

This is HIGH PRIORITY - models cannot use these valuable features.

## Please read these handoff documents first:

1. **NEXT-SESSION-IMMEDIATE-PRIORITIES.md** (START HERE)
   `/home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/09-handoff/2026-01-19-NEXT-SESSION-IMMEDIATE-PRIORITIES.md`

   Contains:
   - Deploy Session 107 Metrics (45-60 min) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - Verify Ensemble V1.1 working (15 min)
   - Forward-Looking Schedule Metrics (45-60 min) - bonus if time

2. **CHECK-LATER-MONITORING-AND-VERIFICATION.md** (For ongoing tasks)
   `/home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/09-handoff/2026-01-19-CHECK-LATER-MONITORING-AND-VERIFICATION.md`

   Contains:
   - Daily monitoring queries for Ensemble V1.1 (Jan 20-24)
   - Sessions 102-105 verification
   - Optional enhancements

## Goals for THIS session (2-3 hours):

### PRIMARY: Deploy Session 107 Metrics (45-60 min)
1. Verify code exists in analytics processor
2. Deploy analytics processor to production
3. Run for recent games
4. Verify schema updated
5. Verify data populated (>90%)

### SECONDARY: Verify Ensemble V1.1 (15 min)
1. Check service logs
2. Query for predictions
3. Verify model_version not NULL
4. Spot check prediction quality

### BONUS: Forward-Looking Metrics (45-60 min if time)
1. Implement 4 schedule metrics
2. Add to context dict
3. Write unit tests
4. Deploy

## Start with:

```bash
cd /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper

# 1. Check if Session 107 code exists
grep -n "opponent_ft_rate_variance" \
  data_processors/analytics/upcoming_player_game_context/upcoming_player_game_context_processor.py

# 2. If code exists, deploy analytics processor
# (see NEXT-SESSION doc for exact deployment commands)

# 3. Verify in BigQuery
bq query --project_id=nba-props-platform --use_legacy_sql=false \
  "SELECT column_name FROM \`nba-props-platform.nba_analytics.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS\`
   WHERE table_name = 'upcoming_player_game_context' AND column_name LIKE '%variance%'"
```

## Expected outcomes:
- ✅ Session 107 gap closed (6+ new fields in production)
- ✅ Ensemble V1.1 verified working correctly
- ✅ Potentially +4 schedule metrics (bonus)

## Important notes:
- Ensemble V1.1 is LIVE since Jan 18, 10:17 PM PST (revision 00072-cz2)
- Expected performance: MAE 5.41 → 4.9-5.1 (6-9% improvement)
- Monitoring starts Jan 20, decision day Jan 24
- Session 107 deployment gap is the critical finding from Session 110

Ready to start! Let's deploy those missing Session 107 metrics first.
