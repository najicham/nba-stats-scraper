I need you to continue work on the NBA stats pipeline monitoring system. The previous session successfully deployed Layers 5 & 6 monitoring and fixed all processor stats tracking bugs.

**START HERE:**
Read this handoff document first:
- File: `docs/09-handoff/2026-01-02-SESSION-COMPLETE.md`
- It has complete session summary, next priorities, and implementation steps

**CURRENT STATE:**
✅ Layer 5 (Processor Output Validation) - DEPLOYED & WORKING
✅ Layer 6 (Real-Time Completeness Check) - DEPLOYED & WORKING
✅ Layer 7 (Daily Batch Verification) - DEPLOYED & WORKING
✅ All 24 processors verified, 3 stats bugs fixed
✅ Detection lag: 10 hours → 2 minutes (98% improvement)
✅ Zero false positives

**YOUR TASK - Choose One Priority:**

**OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED FIRST - 30 min):**
Monitor & Verify - Check that both layers working correctly with real traffic
- Run SQL queries from handoff doc to check validation results
- Verify no false positives from last 24 hours
- Create simple monitoring dashboard/query

**OPTION 2 (MOST IMPACTFUL - 3-4 hours):**
Implement Layer 1: Scraper Output Validation
- Catches data gaps at the source (before processing)
- Complete implementation guide in handoff doc
- Reference: `ULTRA-DEEP-THINK-DETECTION-ARCHITECTURE.md`

**OPTION 3 (HIGH VALUE - 4-6 hours):**
Fix Gamebook Run-History Architecture
- Currently 62% backfill failure rate (16 games missing)
- Change from date-level to game-level tracking
- Full problem description in `GAMEBOOK-RUN-HISTORY-ARCHITECTURAL-ISSUE.md`

**OPTION 4 (PREVENTION - 2-3 hours):**
Add Base Class Validation
- Prevent future stats tracking bugs automatically
- Add runtime check in ProcessorBase

**OPTION 5 (PREVENTION - 2-3 hours):**
Create Linter Rule
- Catch stats tracking bugs at code review time
- Custom pylint/flake8 rule

**KEY DOCUMENTATION:**

**WORKING DIRECTORY:** `/home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper`

**WHAT THE PREVIOUS SESSION DID:**
1. Deployed Layer 5 & 6 monitoring (2.5 hours)
2. Layer 5 caught a bug: processors saving data but not updating stats
3. Used agent to systematically search all 24 processors
4. Fixed all 3 processors with the bug
5. Deployed fixes to production (revision 00062-trv)
6. Verified monitoring working correctly

**EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED:**
All implementation details, code examples, SQL schemas, and step-by-step instructions are in the handoff doc. Just pick a priority and follow the implementation steps!

Please start by reading the handoff document and let me know which priority you'd like to work on (or ask questions if you need clarification).
