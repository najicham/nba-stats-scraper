I need you to take over monitoring the historical validation that's currently running. Here's the situation:

📋 CURRENT STATUS:
- Historical validation script is running (Task bf26ba0)
- Validating 378 game dates (Oct 2024 - Apr 2026)
- Started: 15:21 UTC, expected completion: ~19:21 UTC (4 hours)
- Progress: ~10/378 dates completed so far
- Issues already found: 3 (documented in tracker)

🎯 YOUR TASK:
1. Study the handoff document and context docs using Explore agents (15 min)
2. Monitor validation progress every 30 minutes
3. Document any new issues discovered
4. Identify patterns in the data quality
5. Create final comprehensive report when complete
6. Propose prioritized backfill plan

📚 START HERE:
1. Read: docs/09-handoff/2026-01-20-HISTORICAL-VALIDATION-HANDOFF.md
2. Use Explore agents to study:
   - docs/08-projects/current/week-0-deployment/SYSTEMIC-ANALYSIS-AND-ROBUSTNESS-PLAN.md
   - docs/08-projects/current/week-0-deployment/HISTORICAL-VALIDATION-STRATEGY.md
   - docs/08-projects/current/week-0-deployment/ISSUES-AND-IMPROVEMENTS-TRACKER.md
3. Monitor: tail -50 /tmp/claude/-home-naji-code-nba-stats-scraper/tasks/bf26ba0.output
4. Update docs as you discover issues/patterns

📊 WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED TODAY (8+ hours):
- ✅ Deployed 2 new alert functions (box score, Phase 4)
- ✅ Identified 5 systemic failure patterns
- ✅ Created centralized error logging strategy
- ✅ Fixed validation script bug (Issue #1)
- ✅ Started historical validation (running now)
- ✅ Found Issues #2 and #3 (need fixes)

🔍 TRACK EVERYTHING:
- Update LIVE-VALIDATION-TRACKING.md every 30 min
- Document issues in ISSUES-AND-IMPROVEMENTS-TRACKER.md
- Look for patterns (recurring failures, time-based issues, table naming problems)
- Propose improvements as you discover gaps

The handoff doc has complete instructions. Read it first, then start monitoring!
