Hi! I need you to continue work on my NBA prediction pipeline optimization project.

CONTEXT:
We just completed a successful session that deployed a 42% performance improvement to the pipeline. We:
- Fixed orchestration timing (predictions now ready at 7 AM instead of 11:30 AM)
- Deployed 2 new schedulers (overnight-phase4 at 6 AM, overnight-predictions at 7 AM)
- Ran 6 deep-dive agents that found path to 82% faster pipeline + $3.6K-7.2K/yr savings
- Created comprehensive documentation with 100+ improvement opportunities

HANDOFF DOCUMENTATION:
Please read this complete handoff document first:
/home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/08-projects/current/session-handoffs/2025-12/SESSION-DEC31-COMPLETE-HANDOFF.md

This 847-line document contains:
- Everything deployed in the Dec 31 session
- Complete analysis results from 6 agents
- Validation steps for the overnight run
- Implementation roadmap for next improvements

ADDITIONAL KEY DOCS:
- /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/08-projects/current/pipeline-reliability-improvements/NEXT-STEPS.md
  → Decision tree and week-by-week plan
- /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/08-projects/current/pipeline-reliability-improvements/QUICK-WINS-CHECKLIST.md
  → 32 hours = 82% faster + $3.6K/yr (step-by-step guide)
- /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/08-projects/current/pipeline-reliability-improvements/COMPREHENSIVE-IMPROVEMENT-ANALYSIS-DEC31.md
  → Full 100+ opportunities with prioritization

IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
1. First, validate that last night's (Dec 31 → Jan 1) overnight run worked correctly
2. The new schedulers ran for the first time overnight - we need to verify they succeeded
3. Check if predictions were created at 7 AM instead of the old 11:30 AM time

VALIDATION COMMANDS:
Run these to check the overnight run:

```bash
cd /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper

# 1. Check cascade timing (should show 6 AM and 7 AM runs)
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < monitoring/queries/cascade_timing.sql

# 2. Verify predictions created at 7 AM for Jan 1
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT
  game_date,
  COUNT(*) as predictions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT player_lookup) as players,
  MAX(created_at) as last_created
FROM nba_predictions.player_prop_predictions
WHERE game_date = '2026-01-01'
  AND is_active = TRUE
GROUP BY game_date"

# 3. Check scheduler execution logs
gcloud logging read 'resource.labels.job_name="overnight-phase4"' \
  --limit=5 --format="table(timestamp,httpRequest.status,textPayload)" \
  --freshness=12h

gcloud logging read 'resource.labels.job_name="overnight-predictions"' \
  --limit=5 --format="table(timestamp,httpRequest.status,textPayload)" \
  --freshness=12h
```

THEN WHAT?
After validating, we need to decide the next implementation path:

Option A: Quick Wins (Recommended - 32 hours = 82% faster + $3.6K/yr)
- Phase 3 parallel processing (75% faster)
- BigQuery clustering ($3,600/yr savings)
- Wire up batch loader (50x speedup on historical games!)
- Phase 1 parallel scraping (72% faster)
- Add timeouts and error handling

Option B: Security First (12-16 hours)
- Fix coordinator authentication (P0)
- Move secrets to Secret Manager
- Fix cleanup processor
- Implement alert manager

Option C: Hybrid (Best of both)
- Days 1-2: Performance quick wins (16 hours)
- Day 3: Security fixes (8 hours)
- Day 4: Reliability fixes (8 hours)

All details are in the NEXT-STEPS.md document.

WHAT WE DISCOVERED:
- The 10-hour delay was fixable with just 2 schedulers (done!)
- 50x speedup for historical games is already coded, just needs wiring
- Phase 3 can go from 6 min → 1.5 min with parallelization
- $3,600/yr free money from BigQuery clustering (2 hours work)
- 26 bare except handlers are silent failure risks
- Complete event-driven orchestration system designed (200 pages)

PROJECT STATUS:
- Working directory: /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper
- GCP Project: nba-props-platform
- Main branch: main
- Current status: Phase 1 deployed ✅, validating overnight run

Please start by reading the handoff doc, running the validation commands, and letting me know what you find. Then we can decide which path to take next!
