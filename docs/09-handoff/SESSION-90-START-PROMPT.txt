Hi! Continuing NBA Grading Phase 3 from Session 89.

Context:
- Session 89: Implemented Calibration Insights (Phase 3A) ✅
  - Dashboard tab showing confidence calibration metrics
  - Alert service enhancement for poor calibration detection
  - Identified critical issue: similarity_balanced_v1 is 27 pts overconfident
- Sessions 85 + Phases 1-2: Core grading system + alerts + dashboard complete
- 4,720 predictions graded (Jan 14-16, 2026)

Current state:
- Calibration dashboard ready to deploy
- Alert service monitoring calibration health daily
- Need more historical data for better statistical significance

What I want to build next (Phase 3 continuation):

Priority 1 - Historical Backfill (30 min):
- Grade all predictions from Jan 1-13, 2026
- Gives us 16 days of data instead of 3
- Better statistical significance for all metrics
- Foundation for ROI calculator and other features

Priority 2 - ROI Calculator (2-3 hours):
- Create BigQuery view simulating betting returns
- Dashboard integration showing theoretical P&L
- Metrics: win rate, ROI%, expected value, net profit
- Assume -110 odds (standard sportsbook)
- Compare flat betting vs confidence-weighted strategies

Optional if time:
- Player Insights (top/bottom performers)
- Weekly summary alerts

Reference docs:
- Handoff: docs/09-handoff/SESSION-89-CALIBRATION-COMPLETE.md
- Phase 3 Plan: docs/09-handoff/PHASE-3-START-HERE.md

Can you help continue Phase 3 implementation starting with historical backfill?
