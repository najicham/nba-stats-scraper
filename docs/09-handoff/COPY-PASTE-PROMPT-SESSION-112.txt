I'm continuing Phase 1 implementation from Session 112 (health endpoints & reliability improvements).

Please read this handoff document first:
docs/09-handoff/SESSION-112-PHASE1-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md

## What Session 112 completed:

✅ ALL Phase 1 code implementation (12 new modules)
✅ 47 passing unit tests
✅ Complete documentation (8 files)
⏳ Zero deployments done yet (intentional - needs testing first)

## What I need to do THIS session:

PRIMARY GOAL (4-6 hours): Deploy to Staging
1. Deploy prediction-coordinator to staging using new canary script
2. Test /health and /ready endpoints work correctly
3. Deploy remaining 5 services to staging
4. Run smoke tests and verify all pass
5. Monitor staging logs for issues

SECONDARY GOAL (4-6 hours, if time): Begin Code Integration
6. Integrate retry jitter into existing retry logic
7. Integrate connection pools into BigQuery/HTTP code
8. Test integrated changes in staging

## Start with:

Deploy the prediction-coordinator to staging first. The handoff doc has the exact deployment commands and testing procedures.

Let's begin with deploying to staging and testing the new health endpoints.
