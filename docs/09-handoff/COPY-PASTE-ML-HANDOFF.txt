I'm taking over the ML model development project for NBA points prediction.

CRITICAL DISCOVERIES FROM JAN 3 INVESTIGATION:
==============================================

Previous session found that v4 training results were completely misinterpreted due to two bugs:

BUG 1 - Training Script (CRITICAL):
- File: ml/train_real_xgboost.py, lines 518-528
- Issue: Compares against corrupted mock_prediction column
- Reports: 9.19 MAE (v4) or 8.65 MAE (v3) as baseline
- Reality: Production mock is 4.27 MAE (verified from BigQuery)
- Impact: All models falsely claim "46% improvement" when actually 14-16% WORSE

BUG 2 - Documentation:
- v3 handoff doc reported 4.63 MAE
- Actual saved v3 model has 4.94 MAE
- Two training runs occurred, doc referenced wrong one

CORRECTED PERFORMANCE NUMBERS:
==============================
Production mock (xgboost_v1): 4.27 MAE ← THE REAL BASELINE
v4 model (latest, 21 features): 4.88 MAE (-14.3% worse than production)
v3 model (saved, 25 features): 4.94 MAE (-15.7% worse than production)
v2 model (14 features): 4.63 MAE (-8.4% worse than production)

KEY INSIGHT:
v4 IS 1.2% BETTER than v3 (4.88 vs 4.94), despite initial perception it was worse.

THE PROBLEM:
After 4 training attempts (v1, v2, v3, v4), none beat the hand-tuned mock baseline.
Mock uses explicit domain-expert rules that XGBoost can't learn from 64K samples.

DECISION POINT - THREE OPTIONS:
================================

OPTION A: Accept Mock Baseline (RECOMMENDED)
- Fix training script bug (30 min)
- Document that 4.27 MAE is production standard
- Stop trying to beat mock with current approach
- Focus on: data quality, backfill, feature collection
- Revisit ML in 3-6 months with >100K samples
- Effort: 1 hour
- Probability of better outcome: 90% (focus on high-ROI work)

OPTION B: Try v5 Model (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Fix training script bug (30 min)
- Try aggressive changes: ensemble/LightGBM/deep learning
- Train v5 model
- Effort: 2-8 hours depending on approach
- Probability of beating 4.27: 5-30% (low)

OPTION C: Just Fix Bug (MINIMAL)
- Fix training script mock comparison (30 min)
- Leave decision for later
- Effort: 30 minutes
- Kicks can down road

MY TASK:
========
1. Read the investigation findings (required reading below)
2. Decide which option to pursue
3. If Option A or B: Fix the bug
4. If Option A: Document decision and update project status
5. If Option B: Choose v5 approach and execute

REQUIRED READING (in order):
============================
1. START HERE (2 min):
   docs/09-handoff/2026-01-03-ML-V4-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md

2. FULL DETAILS (15 min):
   docs/09-handoff/2026-01-03-ML-V4-INVESTIGATION-FINDINGS.md
   (includes detailed bug fix code in Option C section)

3. PROJECT STATUS:
   docs/08-projects/current/ml-model-development/STATUS-2026-01-03-UPDATED.md

KEY FILES:
==========
Bug location: ml/train_real_xgboost.py (lines 518-528)
Production mock: predictions/shared/mock_xgboost_model.py (4.27 MAE)
v4 model: models/xgboost_real_v4_21features_20260102.json (4.88 MAE)
v3 model: models/xgboost_real_v3_25features_20260102.json (4.94 MAE)

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
=====================
Please read the executive summary first, then:
1. Confirm you understand the situation
2. Recommend which option (A, B, or C) we should pursue
3. Explain your reasoning

Let's start by having you read the executive summary and tell me what you think.
