## Quick Start for Next Session

### 1. Copy This Prompt Into Fresh Session

📋 **File:** `docs/09-handoff/session-prompts/COMPREHENSIVE-TESTING-SESSION-PROMPT.md`

This prompt includes:
- Full context from Session 256
- All Tier 1-3 test queries ready to run
- Decision criteria for each test
- Expected deliverables

**Time:** 8-12 hours total
- Tier 1 (critical): 2-3 hours
- Tier 2 (comprehensive): 4-6 hours
- Tier 3 (advanced): 2-3 hours

---

## What Session 256 Accomplished

✅ **4 Parallel Agents Analyzed All 23 Signals**
- Agent 1: Intersection analysis (combo-only signals are beneficial)
- Agent 2: Segmentation analysis (found 89.3% HR niche for stars OVER)
- Agent 3: Interaction matrix (7x7 pairwise, discovered 79.4% HR combo)
- Agent 4: Zero-pick prototypes (9 fixable with 6-8 hours)

✅ **Key Findings:**
- "Harmful" signals are actually **beneficial combo-only filters** (+11.7% and +19.4% synergy)
- Production-ready combo: `high_edge + minutes_surge` (79.4% HR, 34 picks)
- Largest anti-pattern: `high_edge + edge_spread` 2-way (31.3% HR, loses money)
- Signal families: Universal Amplifiers, Value Signals, Bounce-Back, Redundancy Traps

✅ **Documentation Created:**
- 7 agent analysis deliverables
- Combo-signals guide
- Testing coverage analysis (identified gaps)
- Comprehensive signal analysis (synthesis)
- Final handoff with all decisions

✅ **Current Confidence:**
- HIGH (>80%): Anti-patterns, 100+ sample decisions
- MODERATE (50-80%): Production combo (needs temporal validation)
- LOW (<50%): Small sample combos (N < 15)

## What Needs to Be Done (Next Session)

### Phase 1: Tier 1 Critical Validation (2-3 hours) — HIGHEST PRIORITY

Test production combo `high_edge + minutes_surge` across 4 critical dimensions:

1. **Temporal robustness** — Does it work in early/mid/late season?
2. **Home vs away** — Does location matter?
3. **Model staleness** — Does it hold when model is fresh vs stale?
4. **Position split** — Does it work for all positions?

**Goal:** Validate or invalidate production combo with HIGH confidence

**If passes:** Deploy immediately with conditional filters
**If fails:** Back to drawing board

### Phase 2: Tier 2 Comprehensive Testing (4-6 hours) — If Tier 1 Passes

1. **Systematic 3-way combos** — Test all 35 possible 3-way combinations
2. **Rest/B2B analysis** — Does rest matter?
3. **Team strength** — Top teams vs bottom teams?

**Goal:** Discover additional strong combos, identify critical filters

### Phase 3: Tier 3 Advanced Segmentation (2-3 hours) — Optional

1. **Prop type analysis** — Points vs rebounds vs assists?
2. **Conference split** — East vs West?
3. **Divisional games** — Different patterns?

**Goal:** Fine-tune deployment with advanced filters

## Testing Coverage Status

### What We Tested (Session 256)
- **Combinations:** ~26 out of 127 possible (20% coverage for 7 signals)
- **Segments:** 4 out of 50+ possible (8% coverage)
  - Player tier (by line value)
  - Edge magnitude
  - OVER vs UNDER
  - Minutes tier
- **Signals:** 9 out of 23 for performance (39%)

### What We DIDN'T Test (Critical Gaps)
- ❌ Early vs late season (temporal validation)
- ❌ Home vs away
- ❌ Back-to-back games vs rested
- ❌ Model staleness effect
- ❌ Team strength
- ❌ Player position
- ❌ 46+ other segments

**Impact:** MODERATE confidence on production combo (needs validation)

---

## Expected Outcomes from Next Session

### Best Case ✅
- HIGH confidence (>80%) on production combo
- Discover 2-3 additional strong combos (HR > 75%)
- Identify critical filters (home, rest, position) that boost HR +10-15%
- Ready for production deployment

### Moderate Case ⚠️
- MODERATE confidence (60-80%) maintained
- Discover 1-2 additional combos worth monitoring
- Some useful filters identified
- Deploy with caveats

### Worst Case ❌
- Production combo fails temporal validation (HR < 60% in some windows)
- No new strong combos discovered
- Need to revisit signal design
