I'm resuming work on the NBA stats backfill project. A 930-day backfill was started last night (Jan 3, 11:01 PM) to fix 99.5% NULL rate in historical player minutes data.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Backfill processing: 2021-10-01 to 2024-05-01 (930 days)
- Running in: tmux session 'backfill-2021-2024'
- Log file: logs/backfill_20260102_230104.log
- Expected completion: Jan 4, 8:00 AM - 2:00 PM (6-12 hours)
- Parser bug was found and fixed last session

MY TASK:
1. Check if backfill has completed
2. If complete: Validate results (NULL rate should be 35-45%)
3. If validation succeeds: Proceed to ML v3 training
4. If still running: Monitor and wait

KEY CONTEXT:
- Last session fixed a critical parser bug (minutes parsing "MM:SS" → decimal)
- Sample test validated the fix (NULL rate dropped from 98.3% → 0.1%)
- Full backfill expected to process 120K-150K records
- This unblocks ML model v3 training (target MAE <4.00)

HANDOFF DOCUMENT:
Read this first: /home/naji/code/nba-stats-scraper/docs/09-handoff/2026-01-04-NEW-SESSION-START-HERE.md

This document contains:
- Complete status update
- Step-by-step validation queries
- Decision criteria (SUCCESS/PARTIAL/FAILURE)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Next steps for ML training

START BY:
1. Reading the handoff document above
2. Checking backfill status (tmux attach or check logs)
3. Following the validation plan if backfill is complete

Let's check the current status!
