**Current Session**: 82 (Complete)

---

## 🎯 Sessions You Already Created

### ✅ Session 85: NBA Grading (4-6 hours)
**File**: `SESSION-85-START-PROMPT.txt`
**Status**: Chat already created
**Priority**: High (revenue impact)
**When to work on it**: When you want to measure model accuracy

---

### ✅ Session 83: Week 2 Alerts - Quick Version (2-3 hours)
**File**: `SESSION-83-START-PROMPT.txt`
**Status**: Chat already created
**Priority**: High (quick monitoring wins)
**When to work on it**: When you want basic alerts fast

## 🆕 New Sessions to Create

### 🔥 **HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Option C: Backfill Pipeline (15-25 hours)
**File**: `OPTION-C-START-PROMPT.txt`
**Why create NOW**:
- Runs mostly automated in background
- Required for Option D
- Start it running, monitor periodically
- Longer it runs, more data you collect

**Time breakdown**:
- Setup: 3-4 hours active work
- Running: Several days (mostly automated)
- Monitoring: 2-3 hours spread over days

**Copy this file to start**: `docs/09-handoff/OPTION-C-START-PROMPT.txt`

---

### 💡 **QUICK WIN** - Option A: MLB Optimization (4-6 hours)
**File**: `OPTION-A-START-PROMPT.txt`
**Why create when ready**:
- Fast, tangible results (30-40% performance gain)
- Low risk, independent of NBA work
- Good for a focused afternoon session

**When to create**: When you have 4-6 hours and want measurable improvements

**Copy this file to start**: `docs/09-handoff/OPTION-A-START-PROMPT.txt`

---

### 🛡️ **COMPREHENSIVE** - Option B: NBA Alerting Weeks 2-4 (26 hours)
**File**: `OPTION-B-START-PROMPT.txt`
**Why this vs Session 83**:
- Session 83: 4 alerts in 2-3 hours (basic)
- Option B: 10-15 alerts + infrastructure in 26 hours (comprehensive)

**My recommendation**:
- If you already started Session 83, finish it first (quick wins)
- Then create Option B later as "Session 83 Extended" to expand it

**When to create**:
- If you abandon Session 83 and want to do it right from scratch
- OR after Session 83 is done, to expand to full infrastructure

**Copy this file to start**: `docs/09-handoff/OPTION-B-START-PROMPT.txt`

---

### 🚀 **MILESTONE** - Option D: Phase 5 Deployment (13-16 hours)
**File**: `OPTION-D-START-PROMPT.txt`
**⚠️ PREREQUISITE**: Option C must be 80%+ complete first

**Why wait**:
- Needs historical data from Option C to train models
- Can't proceed without that data

**When to create**: After Option C backfill is substantially complete

**Copy this file to start**: `docs/09-handoff/OPTION-D-START-PROMPT.txt`
