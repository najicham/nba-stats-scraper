I'm continuing work from Session 110 (Ensemble V1.1 deployment).

Please read this handoff document first:
docs/09-handoff/2026-01-19-NEXT-SESSION-IMMEDIATE-PRIORITIES.md

## What I need to do:

PRIORITY 1 (45-60 min): Deploy Session 107 Metrics
- Session 107 documentation says "✅ COMPLETE" but verification shows 6+ metrics were NEVER deployed
- Missing: 5 variance metrics + 2 enhanced star tracking fields
- This is blocking models from using valuable features

PRIORITY 2 (15 min): Verify Ensemble V1.1 is working
- Deployed Jan 18 (revision 00072-cz2) but need to verify predictions generating
- Check model_version field is set correctly (was 62.5% NULL before fix)

PRIORITY 3 (45-60 min, if time): Forward-Looking Schedule Metrics
- 4 new metrics with copy-paste ready code templates in the doc

## Start with:

Check if Session 107 code exists and deploy it. The handoff doc has step-by-step instructions.

Let's begin with Priority 1 - deploying those missing Session 107 metrics.
