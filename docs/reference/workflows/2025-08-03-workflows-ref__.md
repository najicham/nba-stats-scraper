### **Planned Backfill Workflows**

#### **NBA Historical Box Scores** üìã **PLANNED**
**Purpose:** Player performance data for all historical games  
**Input:** Game IDs from completed schedule collection  
**Total Scrapers:** 2

| Endpoint | Class Name | ‚úÖ/‚ùå Status | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| `bdl_box_scores` | `BdlBoxScoresScraper` | ‚úÖ | **PRIMARY - Ball Don't Lie data** |
| `nbac_player_boxscore` | `GetNbaComPlayerBoxscore` | ‚úÖ | **BACKUP - Official NBA.com stats** |

- `bdl_active_players` - **No date filters:** Current active only, not good for historical backfill

## **SUMMARY ANALYSIS**

### **Operational Workflows**
**Total Unique Scrapers:** 16 (daily operations)

### **Backfill Workflows** 
**Completed:** 1 scraper (NBA schedules - ‚úÖ 5,583 games collected)  
**Planned:** 4 scrapers (box scores, historical props)

### **Issues Found:**

#### **1. All Scrapers Confirmed Working:**
- `nbac_scoreboard_v2`: ‚úÖ Confirmed working (but may be deprecated by NBA.com in future)
- `nbac_player_movement`: ‚úÖ Confirmed working

#### **2. Technology Switch:**
- **BigDataBall PBP**: Added to Late Night Recovery and Early Morning Final Check workflows
- **PbpStats**: Removed from all workflows (not reliable/not using)

### **Critical Dependencies:**
1. **Revenue Critical:** `oddsa_events` ‚Üí `oddsa_player_props` (Real-Time Business)
2. **Data Chain:** `espn_scoreboard_api` ‚Üí `espn_game_boxscore` (Post-Game, Early Morning)

### **Workflow Optimization Results:**

#### **Operational Workflows:**
- **Morning Operations**: Increased from 6 to 8 scrapers (added schedule backup + injury backup)
- **Real-Time Business**: Increased from 5 to 6 scrapers (added injury backup) - revenue critical
- **Post-Game Collection**: Reduced from 8 to 2 scrapers (removed redundant/unnecessary scrapers)
- **Late Night Recovery**: Reduced from 7 to 3 scrapers (focused on core recovery + BDB + backup)
- **Early Morning Final Check**: Reduced from 7 to 5 scrapers (final attempt + backups) - **5 AM PT**

#### **Backfill Workflows:**
- **Historical Schedules**: ‚úÖ **Complete** - 1 scraper, 4 seasons, 5,583 games
- **Historical Box Scores**: üìã **Planned** - 2 scrapers, ~140k player performances
- **Historical Props**: üìã **Planned** - 2 scrapers, betting line history

### **Key Changes Made:**
1. **Added backup scrapers** - Schedule CDN backup, NBA.com play-by-play backup, Ball Don't Lie injury backup
2. **Removed redundant scrapers** - bdl_player_box_scores (data in bdl_box_scores)
3. **Removed under-study scrapers** - bdl_game_adv_stats (need more analysis)
4. **Optimized timing** - Removed unnecessary 2 AM injury/movement checks
5. **Streamlined post-game collection** - Focused on core data only, ESPN backups in morning
6. **Earlier final check** - Moved from 6 AM to 5 AM PT for better business day prep
7. **Maintained critical paths** - Kept all revenue-critical Odds API workflows intact
8. **Simplified backfill** - Removed date-filter incompatible scrapers

### **Recommended Actions:**

#### **Operational Workflows:**
1. **Update operational workflows** to match this optimized scraper list
2. **Update operational doc** to reflect 16 active workflow scrapers  
3. **Deploy backup monitoring** - Schedule CDN vs API, NBA.com vs BigDataBall play-by-play, NBA.com vs BDL injuries
4. **Monitor NBA.com scoreboard v2** for potential deprecation

#### **Backfill Workflows:**
5. **Create planned backfill workflows** for box scores and historical props
6. **Focus on core data sources** - Ball Don't Lie primary, NBA.com backup
7. **Plan backfill execution timeline** - Phase 2 (box scores) ready for implementation

---

## **Questions for Review:**

### **Operational Workflows:**
1. **Comprehensive backup strategy looks good - ready for deployment?**
2. **Should the operational doc reflect these 16 active scrapers as the new source of truth?**
3. **Are the backup monitoring strategies (Schedule CDN, NBA.com play-by-play, BDL injuries) sufficient?**

### **Backfill Workflows:**
4. **Should I help create the simplified backfill workflow files (box scores + props only)?**
5. **Do you need more details about Box Score vs Player Boxscore scraper differences?**
6. **Should backfill scrapers be included in the main operational doc or separate backfill doc?**
