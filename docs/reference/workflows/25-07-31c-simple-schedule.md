## üéØ **Critical Dependencies**

### **Revenue Critical (System Halts on Failure)**
- `oddsa_events` ‚Üí `oddsa_player_props` (Real-Time Business only)

### **Data Dependencies (Retry on Failure)**
- `espn_scoreboard_api` ‚Üí `espn_game_boxscore` (Post-Game, Early Morning Final Check)

### **All Other Scrapers**
- Non-critical (system continues on individual failures)
- Multiple recovery opportunities across workflows

---

## üìä **Status Tracking & Recovery Strategy**

### **Status Files Written to GCS**
Each workflow writes execution results to:
```
/workflow-status/YYYY-MM-DD/workflow-name-HHhMMm.json
```

**Example:** `/workflow-status/2025-08-01/post-game-collection-20h15m.json`
```json
{
  "workflow": "post-game-collection",
  "execution_time": "2025-08-01T20:15:00Z",
  "scrapers": {
    "espn_scoreboard_api": {"status": "success", "duration": 12.3},
    "espn_game_boxscore": {"status": "failed", "error": "timeout"},
    "bdl_box_scores": {"status": "success", "duration": 45.1}
  }
}
```

### **Current Recovery Approach (Option 1)**
- **Simple**: Recovery workflows run ALL relevant scrapers
- **Reliable**: No complex logic, guaranteed coverage
- **Processor-handled**: Deduplication handled in data layer

### **Future Smart Recovery (Option 2)**
- **Foundation built**: Status files provide data for smart retry logic
- **Upgrade path**: Can implement selective retry when needed
- **Dependency-aware**: Will handle scraper chains intelligently

## üìä **Data Collection Strategy**

- **Early games**: Collected at 8PM PT (East Coast games finished)
- **Late games**: Collected at 11PM PT (West Coast games finished)  
- **Enhanced PBP**: Available 2+ hours after game end (collected at 2AM/6AM)
- **Recovery**: Multiple attempts across 2AM and 6AM windows
- **Deduplication**: Handled by data processors, not workflows
- **Status tracking**: All execution results logged for future optimization
