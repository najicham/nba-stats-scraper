## What's in This Archive

This directory contains documents that were superseded during the planning and design process. They are kept for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the architecture.

### Archived Documents

1. **V1.0-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md**
   - **Superseded by:** V1.0-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-FINAL.md
   - **Why:** Original plan didn't include change detection, Phase 2→3 orchestrator, or backfill scripts
   - **Date archived:** 2025-11-28 9:06 PM PST

2. **GREENFIELD-ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md**
   - **Superseded by:** V1.0-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-FINAL.md + UNIFIED-ARCHITECTURE-DESIGN.md
   - **Why:** Early exploration document before final architecture decisions
   - **Date archived:** 2025-11-28 9:06 PM PST

3. **ACTION-PLAN.md**
   - **Superseded by:** V1.0-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-FINAL.md
   - **Why:** Early iteration of implementation planning
   - **Date archived:** 2025-11-28 9:06 PM PST

4. **MASTER-PLAN.md**
   - **Superseded by:** V1.0-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-FINAL.md
   - **Why:** Intermediate planning document before final decisions
   - **Date archived:** 2025-11-28 9:06 PM PST

5. **00-START-HERE.md**
   - **Superseded by:** README.md + PROJECT-STATUS.md
   - **Why:** Multiple "start here" docs were confusing; consolidated into single README entry point
   - **Date archived:** 2025-11-29

6. **README-START-HERE.md**
   - **Superseded by:** README.md + PROJECT-STATUS.md
   - **Why:** Redundant with consolidated README
   - **Date archived:** 2025-11-29

7. **QUICK-START-GUIDE.md**
   - **Superseded by:** README.md + PROJECT-STATUS.md
   - **Why:** Quick start content integrated into README; PROJECT-STATUS provides concise overview
   - **Date archived:** 2025-11-29

## What to Use Instead

For current, approved documentation, use these files in the parent directory:

### Planning & Implementation
- **README.md** - Single entry point with clear navigation
- **PROJECT-STATUS.md** - Current status and quick overview (5 min)
- **V1.0-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-FINAL.md** - The definitive implementation guide
- **DECISIONS-SUMMARY.md** - Record of all architecture decisions

### Architecture & Design
- **UNIFIED-ARCHITECTURE-DESIGN.md** - Complete technical specification
- **ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md** - Detailed rationale for design choices
- **PUBSUB-INFRASTRUCTURE-AUDIT.md** - Current state analysis

### Future Planning
- **V1.1-REALTIME-SUPPLEMENT.md** - Real-time architecture for v1.1
- **IMPLEMENTATION-FULL.md** - Phase 4→5 specific implementation details

## Why Keep These?

These documents are preserved to:
1. Understand the evolution of architectural thinking
2. See what alternatives were considered
3. Learn from the decision-making process
4. Provide context if questions arise later

**Note:** Do NOT use these documents for implementation. They contain outdated decisions that were revised based on user feedback and further analysis.
