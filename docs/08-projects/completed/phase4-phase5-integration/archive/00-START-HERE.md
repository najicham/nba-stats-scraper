# Phase 4→5 Integration - START HERE

**Created:** 2025-11-28  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Implementation  
**Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to production

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### What This Project Does
Adds event-driven triggering from Phase 4 to Phase 5 so predictions are available **6+ hours earlier** with automatic failure recovery.

### Your Next Steps

1. **[ CRITICAL ] Make Timezone Decision** (5 minutes)
   - Read README.md "Critical Decision: Timezone & SLA" section
   - Choose Option A (10 AM ET SLA) or Option B (7 AM ET SLA)
   - Document your choice

2. **Read ACTION-PLAN.md** (15 minutes)
   - Understand the 6-phase implementation plan
   - Review timeline (1-2 weeks)
   - Check pre-deployment checklist

3. **Review Architecture** (10 minutes)  
   - Read README.md for architecture overview
   - Understand hybrid Pub/Sub + scheduler approach

4. **Start Implementation** (When ready)
   - Follow ACTION-PLAN.md Phase 1: Core Integration
   - Reference IMPLEMENTATION.md for code details

## 📁 Document Guide

| Document | Purpose | When to Read |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **README.md** | Architecture overview, key decisions | Read first (15 min) |
| **ACTION-PLAN.md** | Step-by-step implementation plan | Before starting work |
| **IMPLEMENTATION.md** | Code changes and deployment | During development |
| **OPERATIONS.md** | Troubleshooting and rollback | After deployment |
| **MONITORING.md** | Queries and dashboards | During/after deployment |
| **TESTING.md** | Test procedures | Before production |

## ⚠️ Critical Pre-Work

**Before writing ANY code, you MUST:**

1. ✅ Make timezone SLA decision (see README.md)
2. ✅ Review full external AI specification:
   - `/docs/10-prompts/2025-11-28-phase4-to-phase5-integration-review.md`
3. ✅ Understand current Phase 5 deployment status (unit tests only, never deployed)
4. ✅ Verify staging environment available
5. ✅ Confirm alert system configured (Email + Slack)

## 🎯 What You're Building

**Problem:**  
Phase 4 completes at 12:30 AM PT but Phase 5 waits until 6:00 AM PT to run. 5.5 hours wasted.

**Solution:**  
Hybrid trigger: Pub/Sub (primary) + Cloud Scheduler (backup) + Retry logic

**Result:**  
Predictions ready by 12:33 AM PT (6:33 AM ET) instead of 6:03 AM PT (9:03 AM ET)

---

## 💰 Cost & Effort

**Development:** ~10-12 hours  
**Testing:** 3-5 days (staging validation)  
**Monthly Cost:** ~$5 (negligible)  
**Risk:** Low (rollback plan ready, scheduler backup ensures reliability)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Week 1:**
- Latency: Phase 4→5 < 5 minutes (event-driven working)
- Completion: > 95% of players with predictions
- Alerts: Zero critical failures

**Week 2:**
- Dashboards operational
- Team trained on procedures
- Production-stable, ready for sign-off
