# Documentation Cleanup Task

Please clean up and organize the project documentation. This is a multi-phase task.

## Required Reading First

Before starting, read these two documents:
1. `docs/08-projects/DOCUMENTATION-HYGIENE-GUIDE.md` - The rules and workflow
2. `docs/08-projects/CLEANUP-PROMPT-2026-02.md` - Detailed step-by-step instructions

## Quick Summary

The `docs/08-projects/current/` directory has 125+ projects but most are completed or stale. Your job:

1. **Assess** - Categorize each project (keep/complete/archive)
2. **Summarize** - Extract key learnings before archiving
3. **Move** - Organize projects into proper directories
4. **Sync** - Update root docs (CLAUDE.md, troubleshooting, etc.) with learnings
5. **Report** - Document what was done

## Key Rules

- Don't delete anything, only move
- Summarize learnings BEFORE archiving
- Update root docs with patterns discovered
- Create monthly summaries in `docs/08-projects/summaries/`
- Group archived projects by month

## Start Here

Read the two documents mentioned above, then begin with Phase 1: Assess Current State.

Take your time - this can be split across multiple sessions if needed. Quality over speed.
