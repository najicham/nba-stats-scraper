## 10. Risks & Considerations

### Potential Concerns

**1. Small Sample Size** ⚠️
- Only 2 days of data (Jan 9-10)
- 304 picks (need 1,000+ for confidence)
- **Risk**: Performance may regress to mean
- **Mitigation**: Monitor closely, expect some regression

**2. Beginner's Luck** ⚠️
- Exceptionally high performance (87.5%)
- May not be sustainable long-term
- **Risk**: Natural variance could cause decline
- **Mitigation**: Don't over-leverage, maintain diversification

**3. Overfitting Risk** ⚠️
- ML models can overfit training data
- **Risk**: Poor performance on unseen patterns
- **Mitigation**: Monitor out-of-sample performance, retrain regularly

**4. Line Value Issues** ⚠️
- Many high confidence picks show line_value = 20.0
- Possible placeholder/default value
- **Risk**: Predictions not properly validated against real lines
- **Mitigation**: Verify line data quality, check for default values

**5. UNDER Bias** ⚠️
- 89% of picks are UNDERS (271/304)
- **Risk**: May be exploiting temporary scoring downturn
- **Mitigation**: Monitor league-wide scoring trends

### Risk Management Strategy

1. **Gradual Scale-Up**
   - Week 1: 10% of bankroll
   - Week 2: 20% of bankroll (if 75%+ win rate)
   - Week 3: 30% of bankroll (if 70%+ win rate)
   - Month 2: 50% of bankroll (if 65%+ win rate)

2. **Stop-Loss Triggers**
   - Alert if daily win rate < 60%
   - Reduce allocation if weekly win rate < 65%
   - Pause system if monthly win rate < 55%

3. **Diversification**
   - Keep other systems active (ensemble, similarity)
   - Maintain 10-20% allocation to baseline systems
   - Don't put all eggs in one basket
