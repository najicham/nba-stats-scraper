- ✅ Validation MAE: 3.726 (12.5% better than V1)
- ✅ Deployed to Cloud Run prediction worker
- ✅ Model path: `gs://nba-scraped-data/ml-models/xgboost_v1_33features_20260118_103153.json`

#### Session 2: Track E Baseline + Track A Monitoring (1 hour)

**Track E - Baseline Established:**
- ✅ Ran 5 validation queries capturing current system state
- ✅ Documented Day 0 baseline metrics
- ✅ Created `day0-baseline-2026-01-18.md`

**Key Findings:**

- ✅ All 6 prediction systems active and healthy
- ✅ Zero placeholder predictions (quality gate working)
- ✅ High confidence scores (0.77 avg = 77%)
- ⚠️ **Critical Issue:** XGBoost V1 not being graded since 2026-01-10
- ⚠️ model_version = NULL (Session 102 fix may not have worked)

**Track A - Monitoring Implemented:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive monitoring queries (6 queries)
- ✅ Tested primary daily monitoring query
- ✅ Created tracking routine document
- ✅ Established daily/weekly check procedures

**Files Created:**
- `track-e-e2e-testing/results/day0-baseline-2026-01-18.md`
- `track-a-monitoring/daily-monitoring-queries.sql`
- `track-a-monitoring/TRACKING-ROUTINE.md`

**Next Steps:**
1. ⚠️ Investigate XGBoost V1 grading gap (priority)
2. Monitor coordinator execution at 23:00 UTC tonight
3. Decision: Continue to Track D (pace features) or create handoff

**Blockers:** XGBoost V1 grading issue (under investigation)

**Time Spent:** 3 hours total (2h setup + 1h monitoring)

#### Session 3: Track D Discovery (15 mins)

**Track D - Already Complete!**

**Time Spent:** 3.25 hours total (2h setup + 1h monitoring + 0.25h Track D verification)

#### Session 4: Investigation Resolution + 6-System Architecture Discovery (2 hours)

**Investigation Resolved:**
- ✅ **XGBoost V1 "grading gap" - NOT A BUG**
- ✅ Investigated complete system architecture via agents
- ✅ Discovered XGBoost V1 was removed (Jan 8), then restored alongside CatBoost V8 (Jan 17)
- ✅ Confirmed NEW XGBoost V1 V2 model deployed Jan 18 (3.726 MAE validation)

**System Architecture Update - 6 Concurrent Systems:**
- ✅ **System 1:** Moving Average Baseline
- ✅ **System 2:** Zone Matchup V1
- ✅ **System 3:** Similarity Balanced V1
- ✅ **System 4:** XGBoost V1 V2 (NEW - deployed Jan 18, 280 predictions)
- ✅ **System 5:** CatBoost V8 (Champion - 3.40 MAE, 293 predictions)
- ✅ **System 6:** Ensemble V1 (uses CatBoost internally)

**Key Discovery Timeline:**
- **Jan 8:** XGBoost V1 → CatBoost V8 (replacement, commit 87d2038c)
- **Jan 11-16:** Only 5 systems running (no XGBoost V1)
- **Jan 17:** Champion/Challenger framework - both XGBoost V1 + CatBoost V8 (commit 289bbb7f)
- **Jan 18 (TODAY):** New XGBoost V1 V2 model deployed with full backfill training

**Investigation Document Updated:**
- ✅ INVESTIGATION-XGBOOST-GRADING-GAP.md marked as RESOLVED
- ✅ Timeline documented with commits and evidence
- ✅ Confirmed grading will resume Jan 19 (no bug exists)

**Critical Insight:**
- Grading processor has NO system-specific filtering
- XGBoost V1 predictions will be graded tomorrow (Jan 19) when Jan 18 games complete
- The "gap" was simply when XGBoost V1 didn't exist in the system (Jan 8-16)

**Session 102 Optimizations Confirmed:**
- ✅ Batch loading: 75-110x speedup (225s → 2-3s)
- ✅ Persistent state: Firestore-based (survives container restarts)
- ✅ Staging tables: No DML concurrency limits
- ✅ Circuit breakers: Graceful degradation per system

**Next Steps:**
1. Establish XGBoost V1 V2 Day 0 baseline (run Track A queries)
2. Monitor 3-5 days of production performance
3. Decide: Track B (Ensemble) if stable, OR Track E (E2E Testing)

**Time Spent:** 5.25 hours total (3.25h + 2h investigation)

- Training on 11x more data improved MAE by 12.5%
- 739 dates of historical data provides robust training
- Validation performance (3.726) very close to CatBoost (3.40)

**Append-Style Documentation Works:**
- Historical performance tracking maintained
- Clear evolution from V1 → V2 visible
- Easy to compare before/after metrics

**Next Model Improvement Clear:**
- Ensemble V1 still using old XGBoost (4.26 MAE)

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### XGBoost V1 V2 Characteristics
- **Feature Importance Shift:** vegas_points_line dropped from 18.5% to 12.6%
- **Recent Performance Focus:** points_avg_last_5 + last_10 = 54.5% combined
- **Excellent Generalization:** Train/Val gap only 0.453 points
- **No Early Stopping:** Used all 1000 iterations (V1 stopped at 521)

### Opportunities Identified
1. Ensemble V1 improvement (high impact, medium effort)
2. Additional pace features ready to implement (13 total stubbed)
3. Monitoring infrastructure exists, needs activation
4. A/B testing framework in place for model comparison

### Questions to Explore
- How does XGBoost V1 V2 perform on OVER vs UNDER predictions?
- What's the head-to-head win rate vs CatBoost V8?
- Can Ensemble beat both individual models?
- What confidence thresholds maximize win rate?
