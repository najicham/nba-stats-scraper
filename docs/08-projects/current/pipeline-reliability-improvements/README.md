# Pipeline Reliability Improvements Project

**Created:** December 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Quick Wins In Progress
**Priority:** Critical
**Total Issues Identified:** 200+
**Implemented So Far:** 6 quick wins ($5.1K/yr + 57% faster)

---

## Overview

This project consolidates all pipeline reliability improvements discovered through comprehensive agent-based exploration. The goal is to achieve a self-healing, well-monitored pipeline that can recover from failures automatically and alert operators before issues impact predictions.

### Recent Additions (Dec 31, 2025)

**BDL Data Quality Issue & Solution**
- Discovered BDL API reliability issues (Nov-Dec 2025 outages)
- Backfilled 29 missing games from 4 dates
- Designed comprehensive 3-layer monitoring architecture
- See: `BDL-DATA-QUALITY-ISSUE.md` for details

## Current Status (Jan 1, 2026 - 2:00 AM PST)

### ✅ Completed Jan 1 Session (1 hour) - INJURY DATA FIX!

**AUTOMATIC PIPELINE RESTORED:**
- 🎯 **Injury Data Pipeline** - Broken since Dec 23, 2025
  - Root cause: Scraper published PDF path instead of JSON path to Pub/Sub
  - Impact: Processor couldn't handle PDF paths, data didn't reach BigQuery
  - See: `2026-01-01-INJURY-FIX-IMPLEMENTATION.md` for full details

**DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION:**
1. ✅ **Scraper Fix** - Reordered exporters
   - File: `scrapers/nbacom/nbac_injury_report.py`
   - Change: JSON exporter first (published), PDF second (archived)
   - Deployed: `nba-scrapers` revision `00087-mgr`
   - Status: JSON path now published to Pub/Sub ✅

2. ✅ **Orchestrator Updated**
   - Deployed: `nba-phase1-scrapers` revision `00064-pqj`
   - Configured: SERVICE_URL points to nba-scrapers
   - Status: Ready for automatic hourly runs ✅

**FIX VERIFIED END-TO-END:**
- ✅ JSON path published: `.../injury-report-data/.../json`
- ✅ Processor received JSON (not PDF)
- ✅ BigQuery updated: 130 records for 2026-01-01
- ✅ Both files created (JSON + PDF, correct one published)

**TOTAL VALUE:**
- 🛡️ **Automatic pipeline restored** - No manual intervention needed
- 🔧 **Root cause fixed** - Simple, maintainable solution
- 📋 **Documented** - Clear comments prevent future regression
- ⏰ **Next run**: 2:05 AM - will verify automatic processing works

**COMMIT:** `442d404` - "fix: reorder injury scraper exporters to publish JSON path to Pub/Sub"

**DOCUMENTATION:**
- `2026-01-01-INJURY-FIX-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete session summary (600+ lines)
- `2026-01-01-INJURY-FIX-HANDOFF.md` - Original handoff document

### ✅ Completed Dec 31 Evening Session (3 hours) - CRITICAL BUG FIX!

**INCIDENT RESOLVED:**
- 🚨 **December 30th Gamebook Failure** - All 4 games failed to scrape
  - Root cause: Deployment script bug (SERVICE_URL misconfiguration)
  - Impact: Missing gamebook data, degraded predictions
  - See: `INCIDENT-2025-12-30-GAMEBOOK-FAILURE.md` for full analysis

**DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION:**
1. ✅ **Immediate Fix** - SERVICE_URL corrected on orchestrator service
   - Changed: `https://nba-phase1-scrapers-...` → `https://nba-scrapers-...`
   - Deployed: Revision `nba-phase1-scrapers-00058-59j`
   - Status: Orchestrator now correctly calls scraper service

2. ✅ **Deployment Script Fix** - Permanent resolution
   - File: `bin/scrapers/deploy/deploy_scrapers_simple.sh`
   - Added: Separate `ORCHESTRATOR_SERVICE` and `SCRAPER_SERVICE` variables
   - Added: Validation and warning messages
   - Prevents: Future deployments from shipping this bug

**DATA RECOVERY:**
- ✅ All 4 gamebook PDF files scraped and saved to GCS
- ✅ 1/4 games processed into BigQuery (PHI@MEM)
- ⏳ 3/4 games pending BigQuery processing (awaiting cleanup processor)

**TOTAL VALUE:**
- 🛡️ **Critical bug fixed** - Prevented future data loss
- 📋 **Incident documented** - Root cause analysis complete
- 🔧 **Deployment improved** - Script now validates configuration
- 📚 **Architecture clarified** - Two-service design documented

### ✅ Completed Dec 31 PM Session (2.5 hours) - NEW!

**DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION:**
1. ✅ **BigQuery Clustering** → $3,600/yr savings
   - Table: `player_prop_predictions`
   - Fields: `player_lookup`, `system_id`, `game_date`
   - Impact: 30-50% query cost reduction

2. ✅ **Phase 3 Parallel Execution** → 57% faster
   - Sequential: 122s → Parallel: 52s
   - All 5 analytics processors run simultaneously
   - Tested with replay system ✅

3. ✅ **Worker Concurrency Optimization** → $1,500/yr savings
   - Max instances: 20 → 10 (50% reduction)
   - Still processes 450 players in 2-3 minutes

4. ✅ **Reliability Improvements** → 21 fixes
   - 16 BigQuery timeouts added
