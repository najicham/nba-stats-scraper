=== VALIDATION GATE EFFECTIVENESS ===

Before Deployment: 28 placeholders found and deleted
After Deployment: 0 placeholders ✅

Validation gate blocks:
1. Explicit 20.0 placeholder lines
2. Invalid line_source (NULL, NEEDS_BOOTSTRAP)
3. NULL lines with has_prop_line=TRUE

=== KEY ACHIEVEMENTS ===

✅ Validation gate restored (critical for data integrity)
✅ All placeholders removed from database
✅ 7 dates regenerated successfully with XGBoost V1
✅ CatBoost V8 champion system: 100% coverage
✅ 5/6 systems working for all dates
✅ Database integrity protected going forward

=== PRODUCTION READINESS ===

✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

Systems Status:
- Worker: Healthy (prediction-worker-00063-jdc)
- Coordinator: Healthy (prediction-coordinator-00048-sz8)
- Validation gate: ACTIVE
- CatBoost V8 (3.40 MAE champion): 100% coverage
- Data integrity: PROTECTED

=== NEXT PHASE ===

Phase 5: Production Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploy prediction pipeline to production
- Enable daily automated predictions
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Monitor for 24-48 hours
- Backfill remaining historical gaps if needed
