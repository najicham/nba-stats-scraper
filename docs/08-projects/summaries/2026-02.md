# February 2026 Project Summary

**STATUS: IN PROGRESS** — Updated 2026-02-16 (Session 275)

## Overview

- **Sessions:** 200+ sessions (Sessions 71-275 as of Feb 16)
- **Projects completed:** 25+ major projects
- **Key themes:**
  - Signal system build-out, optimization, and cleanup (Sessions 253-275)
  - Model management overhaul — DB-driven loading (Session 273)
  - Model decay monitoring and automated alerts (Sessions 262-266)
  - Replay and steering framework (Sessions 261-269)
  - Market-pattern UNDER signal discovery (Sessions 274-275)
  - Phase 6 subset exporters and API design
  - All-Star break preparation (Feb 19 readiness)

**Executive Summary (Feb 1-16):** February centered on building, testing, and optimizing the signal system for Best Bets curation. The month saw the signal count go from 6 production signals to a validated 18-signal registry with 10 combos. Major cleanup removed 10 underperforming signals, improving aggregator HR from 60.3% to 73.9%. Model management was overhauled to be DB-driven with auto-registration. The OVER directional bias was resolved by adding 6 market-pattern UNDER signals validated across 2 NBA seasons. System is ready for post-All-Star-break resumption Feb 19.

### 2. Model Management Overhaul (Session 273)

- DB-driven model loading (BigQuery registry as single source of truth)
- Auto-register models from training (`quick_retrain.py`)
- Multi-family retrain script (`./bin/retrain.sh --all`)
- Per-family retrain reminders (Cloud Function, Mon 9 AM ET)
- 7 new registry columns (family, loss_function, quantile_alpha, etc.)

### 3. Deployment & Monitoring (Sessions 213-220, 262-266)

- Cloud Build auto-deploy triggers for all services
- Deployment drift detection (`check-deployment-drift.sh`)
- Pipeline canary queries (30-min auto-heal)
- Grading gap detector (daily 9 AM ET)
- Model performance auto-compute after grading
- Retrain reminder automation (Slack + SMS)

### 4. Phase 6 Exports & API (Sessions 86-91, 267-268)

- 4 new exporters: AllSubsetsPicks, SubsetDefinitions, DailySignals, SubsetPerformance
- GCS API endpoints: signal-health.json, model-health.json, signal-best-bets/{date}.json
- Clean API design (no proprietary details exposed)
- Best bets backfill (Jan 9 - Feb 14)

## Carry-Forward Items (Updated Feb 16)

### P0 — Must Do
- [ ] **Feb 19 readiness validation** — Run validate-daily, verify predictions generate
- [ ] **Retrain V9** — 39+ days stale, well below breakeven
- [ ] **Verify signal cleanup in production** — No removed signal tags in live picks

### P1 — Should Do
- [ ] **Retrain V12** — 16+ days stale
- [ ] **Post-break signal monitoring** — Track bench_under live performance
- [ ] **BEST_BETS_MODEL_ID decision** — Switch from V9 to V12?
- [ ] **Re-evaluate WATCH signals** — After 2+ weeks live data

### P2 — Nice to Have
- [ ] Multi-model aggregation (route UNDER signals to Q43/Q45)
- [ ] combo-registry.json API endpoint
- [ ] V12-Q43/Q45 experiments
- [ ] Documentation archive cleanup (140+ projects)

### Completed
- [x] Signal system build-out (253-258)
- [x] Signal health monitoring (259-260)

## Key Learnings — Strategic Level

### Signal Quality > Signal Quantity
Removing 10 bad signals improved aggregator HR from 60.3% to 73.9%. Bad signals (especially hot_streak_2 with N=416) gave undeserved 2-signal qualification, diluting the pool.

### Market Patterns Are Model-Agnostic
Cross-season validated patterns (bench UNDER, high FT UNDER) hold across different models because they capture market inefficiencies, not model-specific edges.

### Direction Balance Matters
The system had 5 OVER-only signals and 0 UNDER-only signals. Adding 6 UNDER signals resolved this bias and opened new coverage for UNDER-specialist models (Q43/Q45).

### Replay Before Deploy
The steering replay framework (Session 269) proved that removing the health gate would recover +$1,110. Data-driven decisions > gut feelings.

### DB-Driven > Config-Driven
Moving model management to BigQuery registry (Session 273) eliminated config drift and enabled auto-registration from training pipelines.
