## Quick Start (Copy-Paste This)

```
Read NEW-SESSION-SIGNAL-ANALYSIS-PROMPT.md and follow the instructions to spawn 4 agents in parallel for comprehensive signal combination analysis.
```

## What You'll Be Doing

Running **4 agents in parallel** to determine if "harmful" signals should be kept, removed, or marked as combo-only.

**The Discovery:**
- `prop_value_gap_extreme`: 12.5% HR standalone, but 88.9% HR with `high_edge`
- `edge_spread_optimal`: 47.4% HR standalone, but 100% HR in triple combo
- Question: Synergistic or riding coattails?
