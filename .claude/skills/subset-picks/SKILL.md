# /subset-picks - Query Picks from Dynamic Subsets

You are querying picks from the dynamic subset system. This system filters predictions based on both static criteria (edge, confidence) and dynamic daily signals (pct_over).

## Purpose

Query and display picks from any defined dynamic subset, with signal context and performance history.

## Usage

When the user invokes this skill:

```
/subset-picks                              # List available subsets
/subset-picks <subset_id>                  # Today's picks from subset
/subset-picks <subset_id> --history 7      # Last 7 days performance
```

## Workflow

### If no subset specified: List Available Subsets

Query all active subsets and display in a formatted table:

```sql
SELECT
  subset_id,
  subset_name,
  CASE WHEN use_ranking THEN CONCAT('Top ', CAST(top_n AS STRING)) ELSE 'All' END as selection,
  signal_condition,
  notes
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.dynamic_subset_definitions`
WHERE is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY subset_id;
```

**Output format:**

```
## Available Dynamic Subsets

| Subset ID | Name | Selection | Signal | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| v9_high_edge_top5 | V9 Top 5 | Top 5 | ANY | Recommended default |
| v9_high_edge_balanced | V9 High Edge Balanced | All | GREEN | Historical 82% HR |
...
```

### If subset specified: Get Today's Picks

First, determine if the subset uses ranking:

```sql
SELECT use_ranking, top_n, signal_condition, min_edge, min_confidence
FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.dynamic_subset_definitions`
WHERE subset_id = '{SUBSET_ID}' AND is_active = TRUE;
```

Then use the appropriate query:

#### For UNRANKED subsets (use_ranking = FALSE):

```sql
WITH daily_signal AS (
  SELECT * FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.daily_prediction_signals`
  WHERE game_date = CURRENT_DATE() AND system_id = 'catboost_v9'
),
subset_def AS (
  SELECT * FROM `nba-props-platform.nba_predictions.dynamic_subset_definitions`
  WHERE subset_id = '{SUBSET_ID}'
)
SELECT
  p.player_lookup,
  ROUND(p.predicted_points, 1) as predicted,
  p.current_points_line as line,
  ROUND(ABS(p.predicted_points - p.current_points_line), 1) as edge,
  p.recommendation,
  ROUND(p.confidence_score, 2) as confidence,
  s.pct_over,
  s.daily_signal,
  CASE
    WHEN d.signal_condition = 'ANY' THEN '✅ INCLUDED'
    WHEN d.signal_condition = 'GREEN' AND s.daily_signal = 'GREEN' THEN '✅ INCLUDED'
    WHEN d.signal_condition = 'GREEN_OR_YELLOW' AND s.daily_signal IN ('GREEN', 'YELLOW') THEN '✅ INCLUDED'
    WHEN d.signal_condition = 'RED' AND s.daily_signal = 'RED' THEN '✅ INCLUDED'
    ELSE '❌ EXCLUDED (signal mismatch)'
  END as status,
  -- Session 140: Quality visibility fields
  ROUND(f.feature_quality_score, 0) as quality,
  f.quality_tier,
  CASE
    WHEN f.quality_alert_level = 'green' THEN '✅'
    WHEN f.quality_alert_level = 'yellow' THEN '⚠️'
    WHEN f.quality_alert_level = 'red' THEN '🔴'
    ELSE '✅'
  END as data_status,

  AND (d.min_confidence IS NULL OR p.confidence_score >= d.min_confidence)
  AND p.current_points_line IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ABS(p.predicted_points - p.current_points_line) DESC;
```

#### For RANKED subsets (use_ranking = TRUE):

```sql

**Output format for picks:**

```
## {Subset Name} - {Date}

### Signal Status
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| pct_over | X% | {GREEN/YELLOW/RED} |
| Daily Signal | {signal} | {interpretation} |
| Signal Match | ✅/❌ | {reason} |

{If signal mismatch and subset requires specific signal, show warning:}
⚠️ SIGNAL MISMATCH
This subset requires {signal_condition} signal, but today is {daily_signal}.
No picks recommended today based on historical performance.

### Today's Picks
| Rank | Player | Line | Pred | Edge | Dir | Conf | Score | Data |
|------|--------|------|------|------|-----|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Player A | 22.5 | 28.1 | +5.6 | OVER | 0.89 | 100.5 | ✅ |
| 2 | Player B | 18.5 | 24.2 | +5.7 | OVER | 0.82 | 98.1 | ⚠️ |
...

### Data Quality Legend
- ✅ Complete: All matchup data available
- ⚠️ Partial: Some fallback data used
- ❌ Degraded: Matchup-specific factors unavailable (defaulted)

{If any picks have ⚠️ or ❌ data status:}
⚠️ DATA QUALITY NOTE
{N} pick(s) have degraded data quality. Consider reviewing before betting:
- Player B: Matchup factors used defaults (opponent defense data unavailable)
```

**Output format for history:**

```
## {Subset Name} - Last {N} Days Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Days | X |
| Total Picks | Y |
| Wins | Z |
| Hit Rate | W% |

### Interpretation
{Compare to baseline and provide context}
```

## Important Signal Logic

**Signal Condition Matching:**

| Condition | Matches When |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ANY` | Always included, no signal filter |
| `GREEN` | daily_signal = 'GREEN' (pct_over 25-40%) |
| `GREEN_OR_YELLOW` | daily_signal IN ('GREEN', 'YELLOW') |
| `RED` | daily_signal = 'RED' (pct_over <25%) |

**Composite Score Formula:**
```
composite_score = (edge * 10) + (confidence * 0.5)
```

- Edge dominates: 1 point edge difference = 10 score points
- Confidence is tiebreaker: 20% confidence difference = 10 score points
- A 7.2 edge + 87% conf (115.5) beats 5.8 edge + 92% conf (104.0)

## Example Usage

**List all subsets:**
```
User: /subset-picks
→ Display table of all 9 active subsets
```

**Get today's top 5:**
```
User: /subset-picks v9_high_edge_top5
→ Query ranked picks, show top 5 with signal context
```

**Check balanced subset on RED day:**
```
User: /subset-picks v9_high_edge_balanced
→ Show warning that signal is RED, subset requires GREEN
→ Still show picks but with EXCLUDED status
```

**Historical performance:**
```
User: /subset-picks v9_high_edge_top5 --history 14
→ Show last 14 days hit rate for top 5 subset
```

## Notes

1. **Always check signal first** - Show signal status before picks
2. **Warn on mismatches** - If subset requires GREEN but today is RED, warn user
3. **Exclude pushes** - In historical queries, filter `actual_points != line` to exclude pushes
4. **Use composite score for ranking** - Edge * 10 + Confidence * 0.5
5. **Today has no results yet** - Historical queries should exclude CURRENT_DATE()
6. **Quality gate (Session 139/140)** - Picks with `quality_alert_level = 'red'` or `matchup_quality_pct < 50` are now blocked by the hard floor in the quality gate and should not appear in active predictions. If they do, investigate Phase 4 processor status.
7. **prediction_made_before_game (Session 139)** - For historical queries, filter `WHERE prediction_made_before_game = TRUE` to exclude backfill predictions that were generated after game results were known.
